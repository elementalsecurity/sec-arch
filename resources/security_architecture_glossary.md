# Security Architecture Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms, acronyms, and architectural concepts frequently encountered in the field of Security Architecture. It serves as a quick reference for professionals working across infrastructure, application, cloud, and risk domains.

## A
- **ACL (Access Control List)**: A list of rules that define which users or systems are granted or denied access to specific resources.
- **AD (Active Directory)**: A Microsoft directory service used for identity and access management in enterprise environments.
- **API Gateway**: A service that sits in front of APIs to manage authentication, routing, rate limiting, and logging.

## B
- **BIA (Business Impact Analysis)**: The process of determining the effects of disruption to business operations.
- **Blue Team**: The defensive side of a security team responsible for monitoring, detection, and response.

## C
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**: A development practice that enables frequent integration and automated deployment of code changes.
- **CIS Controls**: A prioritized set of actions developed by the Center for Internet Security to protect systems and data.
- **CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)**: A class of tools that continuously monitor cloud environments for security risks.

## D
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**: Technologies and strategies to detect and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attack that attempts to disrupt normal traffic by overwhelming a service with traffic.

## E
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**: A toolset for detecting and responding to threats at the endpoint level.
- **Encryption at Rest**: The practice of securing stored data using cryptographic methods.

## F
- **Federation**: A method that allows identity credentials from one system to be trusted by another system.
- **Fail-Safe Default**: A design principle stating systems should default to a secure state when failures occur.

## G
- **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**: An umbrella term for managing corporate governance, enterprise risk, and regulatory compliance.

## H
- **HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System)**: A system that monitors and analyzes the internals of a computing system.
- **Hashing**: A one-way cryptographic transformation used to protect data integrity and passwords.

## I
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: The discipline of ensuring that the right people have the right access to the right resources.
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Managing infrastructure using machine-readable definition files.

## J
- **JIT (Just-In-Time Access)**: A model where elevated privileges are granted temporarily for a specific purpose.

## K
- **KMS (Key Management Service)**: A service for creating, storing, rotating, and managing encryption keys.
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

## L
- **Least Privilege**: A security principle where users and systems are granted the minimal access necessary.
- **Logging**: The process of recording system and user activity for audit, monitoring, or forensic purposes.

## M
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**: Authentication using two or more factors such as password, device, or biometric.

## N
- **NIST CSF**: A framework by NIST to help organizations assess and improve their cybersecurity posture.
- **NAC (Network Access Control)**: Security controls that restrict device access to a network based on policy.

## O
- **OWASP**: A nonprofit foundation that provides unbiased information about computer security, including the OWASP Top 10.

## P
- **PAM (Privileged Access Management)**: Tools and processes used to secure, monitor, and control access to privileged accounts.
- **Pseudonymization**: A privacy technique that replaces identifying fields in a dataset with artificial identifiers.

## Q
- **Quarantine**: Isolation of potentially harmful files or systems to prevent damage or spread.

## R
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Access control based on the roles assigned to users.
- **RTO / RPO**: Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective â€” metrics for system recovery in BCP/DR.

## S
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Tools that provide real-time analysis of security alerts.
- **SAST / DAST / IAST**: Static, Dynamic, and Interactive Application Security Testing methods.
- **SOC 2**: A compliance framework for managing customer data based on five trust principles.

## T
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: A cryptographic protocol for securing communications over a network.
- **Threat Modeling**: A process for identifying and prioritizing potential threats to a system.

## U
- **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection using behavioral baselines.

## V
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A tool for securely connecting to a private network over the internet.
- **Vulnerability Management**: The practice of identifying, evaluating, and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

## W
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: A firewall that monitors and filters traffic to and from web applications.

## X-Z
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**: A security incident detection and response platform that unifies multiple telemetry sources.
- **Zero Trust**: A security model that assumes breach and enforces strict identity verification for every access request.
