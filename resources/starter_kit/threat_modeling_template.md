# Threat Modeling Worksheet

## System Overview

- **Project Name:**
- **System Description:**
- **Key Assets:**
- **Data Sensitivity Classification:**
- **External Integrations:**

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD) (Optional)

- [ ] Identify major processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows.
- [ ] Highlight trust boundaries.

*(Attach or link to diagram if available.)*

## Threat Identification

Use the STRIDE model or customized threat categories as a guide.

| Threat ID | Description | Affected Component | Threat Category | Preconditions | Likelihood | Impact | Notes |
|:----------|:------------|:-------------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-----------|:------|:------|
| T-001 | | | | | | | |
| T-002 | | | | | | | |
| T-003 | | | | | | | |

(Add rows as needed.)

## Threat Prioritization

- High-priority threats:
- Medium-priority threats:
- Low-priority threats:

*(Prioritization based on risk analysis combining likelihood and impact.)*

## Mitigation Planning

| Threat ID | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status | Notes |
|:----------|:---------------------|:------|:------|:------|
| T-001 | | | | |
| T-002 | | | | |

## Validation and Follow-Up

- [ ] Validate that mitigations are implemented.
- [ ] Review threat model at key project milestones.
- [ ] Update threat model if system design changes significantly.

*Threat modeling is most valuable when it drives secure design decisions, improves risk visibility, and becomes part of a living design process.*
