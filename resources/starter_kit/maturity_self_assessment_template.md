# Security Architecture Maturity Self-Assessment Template

Use this template to benchmark your organization's current security architecture maturity across key capability domains.

---

# Instructions

- Review each capability statement.
- Mark the current status as:
  - [ ] Not Started
  - [ ] Partially Implemented
  - [ ] Fully Implemented
- Focus on evidence-based, honest assessments.
- Use results to guide improvement planning.

---

# Governance and Strategy

- [ ] Security architecture ownership and accountability are clearly defined.
- [ ] A documented security architecture strategy exists and aligns with business goals.
- [ ] Architecture decision-making integrates security systematically.
- [ ] Executive sponsorship supports security architecture efforts.

---

# Architecture Design and Patterns

- [ ] Reusable secure architecture patterns are documented and accessible.
- [ ] Solution and system designs consistently incorporate security requirements.
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are used to capture key tradeoffs.
- [ ] Security architecture review checkpoints are embedded in delivery lifecycles.

---

# Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis

- [ ] Threat modeling is performed early for new systems and major changes.
- [ ] A shared threat library exists and is actively maintained.
- [ ] Threat modeling outputs directly inform control design and risk mitigation.
- [ ] Threat modeling practices are scalable across agile and DevOps workflows.

---

# Secure-by-Design Enablement

- [ ] Secure design principles are documented and adopted.
- [ ] Secure defaults are enforced across platforms and services.
- [ ] Security coaching or training supports secure design practices.
- [ ] Secure design reviews occur at project intake and major milestones.

---

# Architecture Tooling and Automation

- [ ] Architecture diagrams and models are maintained using formal tooling.
- [ ] Threat modeling or security validation tools are integrated into workflows.
- [ ] Automated security validations are performed in CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] Architecture artifacts are version-controlled and linked to risk tracking.

---

# Scoring (Optional)

| Status | Score |
|:-------|:------|
| Not Started | 0 |
| Partially Implemented | 1 |
| Fully Implemented | 2 |

- Add scores by domain to prioritize areas for improvement.
- Focus first on raising domains that score lowest.
