# Global Glossary of Security Architecture Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the "So You Want To Be A Security Architect" repository. It is intended to provide consistent, clear meanings for important concepts.

---

## A

**Access Control**
The process of ensuring that only authorized users can access specific systems, data, or resources.

**Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**
A document that captures a significant architectural decision, the context behind it, the options considered, and the tradeoffs made.

---

## C

**CIA Triad**
The foundational model of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Confidentiality**
Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.

**Control**
A safeguard or countermeasure designed to reduce risk.

**Continuous Improvement**
The ongoing effort to enhance security practices, systems, and architectures through reflection, feedback, and adaptation.

---

## D

**Defense in Depth**
A layered approach to security that provides multiple redundant defenses against threats.

**Design Tradeoff**
A decision balancing conflicting goals such as security, usability, performance, or cost.

**Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
A visual representation of how data moves through a system, including processes, data stores, and external entities.

---

## G

**Governance**
The structures, policies, and processes used to manage and oversee security architecture activities.

---

## L

**Least Privilege**
A principle stating that users, systems, and processes should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions.

**Living Document**
A document that evolves over time through continuous updates and refinements based on learning and environmental changes.

---

## M

**Maturity Model**
A structured framework that describes how capabilities evolve through increasing levels of sophistication and consistency.

---

## R

**Risk**
The possibility that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset.

**Risk Acceptance**
The decision to acknowledge and accept a given risk without further mitigation, typically after evaluating cost-benefit tradeoffs.

---

## S

**Secure-by-Design**
An approach where security is embedded into system and solution design from the outset, rather than added after development.

**Security Architecture**
The practice of designing and maintaining the security structure of systems, services, and organizations to support business objectives securely.

**Security Control**
A technical, administrative, or physical measure implemented to manage risk and protect assets.

**Security Pattern**
A reusable solution to a common security design problem.

**Security Review**
An evaluation of a design, system, or process to assess its security posture and identify potential risks.

**STRIDE**
A threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft, categorizing threats as Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

**Starter Kit**
A collection of ready-to-use templates, checklists, and tools that support immediate adoption of security architecture practices.

---

## T

**Threat**
A potential cause of an unwanted impact to a system or organization.

**Threat Modeling**
The structured practice of identifying and analyzing threats during the system design phase to proactively mitigate risks.

**Trust Boundary**
A point in a system where data or control passes between different trust levels or administrative domains.

---

## Z

**Zero Trust**
A security model that assumes no implicit trust based on network location or ownership and requires continuous verification of user, device, and context before granting access.
