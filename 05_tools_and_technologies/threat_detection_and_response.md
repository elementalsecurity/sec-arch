# Threat Detection and Response Tools

This document outlines the tools and platforms used in security operations to detect, investigate, and respond to threats across the enterprise. These technologies are essential for building visibility, maintaining operational awareness, and enabling effective triage and containment of malicious activity.

---

## Strategic Objectives

- Aggregate and correlate telemetry across endpoints, network, cloud, and identity
- Detect known and unknown threats in real time
- Enable automated or semi-automated response actions
- Integrate threat intelligence to enrich context and inform response
- Support regulatory reporting, forensics, and evidence preservation

## Core Categories

### 1. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

SIEM platforms collect, normalize, correlate, and analyze logs and telemetry from across the environment.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Splunk Enterprise Security** | Scalable log analytics platform with correlation, dashboards, and detection rule management |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | Cloud-native SIEM with integrated UEBA, SOAR, and ML analytics |
| **IBM QRadar** | Enterprise SIEM with deep protocol analysis, threat detection, and offense scoring |
| **Elastic Security (ELK Stack)** | Open SIEM with Kibana dashboards, detection rules, and endpoint telemetry integration |
| **LogRhythm** | Mid-market SIEM with built-in compliance modules and automation |

### Key SIEM Capabilities
- Log aggregation and parsing
- Alert correlation and rule-based detection
- Dashboards, metrics, and visualizations
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- Integration with SOAR and case management

---

### 2. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

SOAR platforms automate detection-to-response workflows and integrate across security stacks.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cortex XSOAR (Palo Alto)** | Full-featured SOAR with playbook orchestration, threat intel integration, and case tracking |
| **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)** | Graphical playbook builder with hundreds of integrations and automation actions |
| **Swimlane** | Low-code SOAR platform for scalable automation and response |
| **Tines** | Lightweight, no-code automation for alerts and workflows |

### SOAR Use Cases
- Auto-triage and enrichment of SIEM alerts
- Automated phishing response
- Threat intel ingestion and correlation
- Ticketing system integration (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)

---

### 3. Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)

TIPs manage external and internal intelligence feeds, integrate indicators into detection systems, and enrich incident context.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MISP** | Open-source platform for sharing indicators of compromise and threat reports |
| **Anomali ThreatStream** | Commercial TIP with threat feed aggregation and SIEM/SOAR integration |
| **Recorded Future** | Intelligence-driven platform with real-time threat scoring and analytics |
| **OpenCTI** | Graph-based, open-source TIP supporting ATT&CK mapping and analyst workflows |

---

## Detection Engineering

Security Architects and Detection Engineers work together to:
- Align detections with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Tune rules to reduce false positives and alert fatigue
- Build use cases mapped to organizational threats and risk tolerance
- Implement detection-as-code practices (e.g., Sigma, YAML-based rule management)

---

## Design Considerations for Security Architects

- Evaluate **telemetry sources and coverage** (cloud, endpoints, identity, network)
- Choose SIEM/SOAR platforms based on **data volume, cost, and use case maturity**
- Prioritize **correlation and response latency** for critical threats
- Integrate **threat intel enrichment and observables management**
- Ensure **compliance-driven logging and audit trails** are preserved

---

## Summary

Threat detection and response tooling forms the analytical and operational backbone of security operations. Security Architects play a key role in designing scalable pipelines that integrate SIEM, SOAR, and TIPs while enabling detection engineering and automated workflows. These tools empower teams to move from alert overload to intelligent action and measurable outcomes.
