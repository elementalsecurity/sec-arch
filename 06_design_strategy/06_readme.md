# 06 - Design Strategy

## Purpose

The Design Strategy section introduces security professionals to the strategic principles required for effective security architecture. It goes beyond frameworks and compliance to focus on resilient, adversary-aware design.  

This section builds the foundation for applying the **ARCH Model** — **Asymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity Hardening** — as the central design lens. Through ARCH, architects learn to shape environments that are not just compliant but inherently disruptive to attackers, sustainable under stress, and aligned to business purpose.

Security design is not merely a technical exercise. It is a strategic discipline that must internalize threat dynamics, operational realities, and organizational goals, blending rigorous modeling with practical adaptability.

## Key Themes

- **Security by Design:** Embedding security into architectures from the earliest conceptual stages rather than layering controls after-the-fact.
- **Architectural Modeling:** Using threat models, security patterns, trust boundaries, and resilience patterns to make risks visible and actionable.
- **Strategic Tradeoff Analysis:** Recognizing and managing inevitable tensions among security, usability, performance, and cost.
- **Alignment to Business Objectives:** Designing architectures that enable critical business functions while improving operational resilience.
- **Adversary-Focused Resilience:** Prioritizing asymmetry, recovery, and simplicity over rigid control inventories.

## What This Section Covers

This section empowers architects and security leaders to design with purpose by providing:

- The mental models needed for **asymmetric security architecture.**
- Structured approaches for integrating **ARCH Pillars** — Asymmetry, Resilience, Cybersecurity-Driven Architecture, and Hardening Through Simplicity — into every design effort.
- Techniques for threat-informed design in Agile, DevOps, hybrid cloud, and legacy environments.
- Methods for identifying critical assets, mapping attack paths, and embedding disruption points into architectural patterns.
- Frameworks for communicating design risks, tradeoffs, and priorities to both technical and business stakeholders.

## How to Use This Section

Whether you are designing new platforms, assessing inherited environments, or leading architectural transformations, this section provides:

- **Conceptual frameworks** to think and reason about security design under uncertainty.
- **Tactical guides** for embedding ARCH principles into system architectures.
- **Practical examples** to translate design theory into operational resilience.

This is not a checklist or a one-size-fits-all method.  
It is a strategic way of thinking — one that will enable you to architect systems that are harder to compromise, faster to recover, and intentionally aligned to business and adversary realities.

## Next Steps

Begin by reviewing the **ARCH Overview** to internalize the strategic pillars.  
Then continue into the detailed guidance on applying asymmetric, resilient, and simplicity-driven design principles across a variety of architectural domains.
