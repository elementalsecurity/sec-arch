# ARCH Tactical Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides a tactical framework for applying the **ARCH Model** — **Asymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity Hardening** — to real-world security program design and operationalization.

While the ARCH Overview defines the philosophy and principles, this guide focuses on **translating those principles into measurable deployment actions** across teams, systems, and timeframes. It is intended for Security Architects, CISOs, DevOps engineers, and security leaders committed to building asymmetric, resilient, and sustainable defense programs.

## Strategic Deployment Sequence

ARCH is best implemented through **four progressive phases**, each aligned with one of the ARCH pillars.

### Phase 1: Architect Asymmetry

**Goal:** Impose disproportionate cost on attackers.

**Tactical Actions:**
- Identify high-value assets and model adversary paths (e.g., ATT&CK mapping, threat modeling).
- Deploy deception techniques such as canaries, sinkholes, and honeypots at lateral movement points.
- Rotate keys and credentials at unpredictable intervals to reduce predictability.
- Remove standard administrative workflows and default ports (e.g., disable RDP/SSH).

### Phase 2: Engineer Resilience

**Goal:** Build for survivability rather than solely prevention.

**Tactical Actions:**
- Define blast radii for critical services and enforce network and identity segmentation.
- Deploy immutable infrastructure and ephemeral workloads (e.g., serverless, containerized systems).
- Favor queue-based messaging over tightly coupled RPCs.
- Automate detection and response workflows with SOAR integrations.

### Phase 3: Elevate Cybersecurity Architecture

**Goal:** Integrate security directly into design and delivery processes.

**Tactical Actions:**
- Embed security architects within platform, application, and cloud engineering teams.
- Maintain reference architectures for IAM, monitoring, Zero Trust models, and incident response playbooks.
- Make threat modeling a mandatory component of architecture review boards.
- Define service-level objectives (SLOs) for detection latency, threat coverage, and operational resilience.

### Phase 4: Harden Through Simplicity

**Goal:** Reduce complexity to minimize exploitability.

**Tactical Actions:**
- Eliminate dormant identities, orphaned endpoints, and non-expiring access privileges.
- Consolidate and simplify RBAC structures into role templates and inheritance models.
- Remove deprecated protocols and unused SaaS integrations.
- Prioritize managed services with secure-by-default configurations over complex custom builds.

## Control Examples Mapped to ARCH

| Control Example | ARCH Pillar | Tactical Detail |
|:----------------|:------------|:----------------|
| Canary tokens in critical file shares | Asymmetry | Trigger early detection by luring attackers into decoy environments. |
| Immutable EC2 instances with golden image pipelines | Resilience | Block post-exploit persistence by eliminating mutable infrastructure. |
| CI/CD security gates for secrets and vulnerability scans | Cybersecurity Architecture | Enforce control validation before deployment events. |
| Access package automation for third parties | Simplicity | Auto-expire external access to minimize identity sprawl. |

---

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Security Architects
- Define resilient security postures by design, not by policy alone.
- Create and maintain architecture patterns and deployment guides aligned to ARCH.
- Map business goals to threat-informed architectural priorities.

### Engineering and DevOps Teams
- Integrate security controls, gates, and scanning tools directly into pipelines.
- Build infrastructure with zero standing access and enforced isolation.
- Automate key and certificate rotation to minimize exposure.

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Leverage ARCH to justify compensating controls and risk acceptance.
- Define acceptable residual risk thresholds based on application tiering.
- Move from control inventory management to threat-informed risk models.

## Metrics and Outcomes

| Metric | Target Measurement | Indicator of Maturity |
|:-------|:--------------------|:----------------------|
| Mean Time to Detect/Contain (MTTD/MTTC) | Less than 10 minutes | Demonstrates operational readiness. |
| Percentage of ephemeral workloads | Greater than 80% | Reduces attack surface and persistence risks. |
| Percentage of privileged access with expiration | 100% | Enforces zero standing privilege. |
| Number of attacker paths blocked at Tier 1 | Increase quarter-over-quarter | Validates threat modeling effectiveness. |

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Treating ARCH as a compliance exercise rather than a design model.
- Applying asymmetry only at the network perimeter instead of across identity, data, and application layers.
- Using ARCH terminology without operationalizing the supporting practices.
- Overengineering complexity in ways that violate the simplicity pillar.

---

## Summary

The ARCH Tactical Implementation Guide translates security philosophy into field-deployable playbooks. It enables teams to ask sharper questions:

- Where does the adversary gain advantage, and how can we disrupt it?
- What are the minimum critical assets we must protect to sustain operations?
- How do we design systems where security is easier to do correctly and harder to ignore?

By following a phased deployment, mapping tactical controls, clarifying team roles, and defining measurable outcomes, security architects and leaders can operationalize security programs that are adversary-aware, resilient by design, and simplified for sustainability.

> "Smarter security is not about having more controls. It is about designing friction into attacker paths and resilience into critical systems. ARCH provides the blueprint."
