# Foundational Challenges

This document presents foundational-level portfolio challenges designed to help aspiring Security Architects apply core concepts.

These exercises focus on practical skill development across threat modeling, architecture principles, secure design reasoning, and basic tradeoff analysis.

Document your work clearly for each challenge. Practice thinking and communicating like a professional architect.

## Challenge 1: Basic Threat Modeling

**Scenario:**
You are asked to perform a basic threat model for a new web-based customer support portal.

**Task:**
- Identify key assets.
- Identify major trust boundaries.
- List at least five realistic threats against the system.
- Suggest one mitigation strategy per threat.

**Hint:** Use frameworks like STRIDE if you want structure.

## Challenge 2: Secure Network Architecture for a Startup

**Scenario:**
A small startup is moving its workloads to AWS. They have a basic SaaS application and a small internal portal.

**Task:**
- Sketch a high-level secure network architecture (VPCs, subnets, gateways, basic controls).
- Identify at least three security risks and describe how your design mitigates them.

**Hint:** Prioritize simplicity and separation of concerns.

## Challenge 3: Identity and Access Management Quick Design

**Scenario:**
A new internal application needs authentication and access control for employees.

**Task:**
- Propose an authentication approach.
- Define at least three user roles and their basic permissions.
- Describe how you would enforce least privilege and periodic access reviews.

**Hint:** Think about integrating with an Identity Provider (IdP).

## Challenge 4: Applying Secure Design Principles

**Scenario:**
You are reviewing the design of a mobile app that handles personal fitness data.

**Task:**
- List five secure design principles that should apply.
- Give a concrete example for how each principle would influence the app's architecture or code.

**Hint:** Principles could include least privilege, fail secure, minimize attack surface, among others.

## Challenge 5: Security Tradeoff Awareness

**Scenario:**
A project team proposes launching an MVP version of an e-commerce platform without encryption for internal service communications to speed up deployment.

**Task:**
- Identify the tradeoff.
- Propose a risk mitigation strategy that balances launch goals with security improvement.
- Describe how you would document and manage this risk if the team proceeds.

**Hint:** Not every risk is a blocker, but every risk needs clear ownership.

---

## Challenge 6: Data Classification and Protection Plan

**Scenario:**
An organization wants to start a project to build a customer loyalty app that will store limited personal information (names, emails, phone numbers).

**Task:**
- Propose a basic data classification for the types of information collected.
- Describe at least three security controls appropriate for protecting this data throughout its lifecycle.

**Hint:** Focus on controls for collection, storage, and transmission.

---

*Completing these challenges builds the foundation for thinking systematically, reasoning about risk, and structuring secure designs. These are essential habits for any serious Security Architect.*
