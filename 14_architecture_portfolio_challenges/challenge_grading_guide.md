# Challenge Grading Guide

This guide provides a simple rubric for evaluating completed Security Architecture Portfolio Challenges.

It can be used for:
- Self-assessment
- Mentor or peer review
- Interview portfolio evaluations

The goal is not to assign numeric scores but to build a mindset of completeness, clarity, realism, and critical reasoning.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension | Key Questions | Evaluation Guidance |
|:----------|:--------------|:---------------------|
| **Understanding of Scenario** | Does the response accurately understand and scope the problem? Are assumptions reasonable and stated clearly? | Clear, concise, and realistic framing of the system and constraints. |
| **Structured Reasoning** | Is the thought process logical? Are decisions explained, not just stated? | Explicit description of why specific design choices were made. |
| **Threat and Risk Awareness** | Are realistic threats identified? Are risks appropriately prioritized? | Not just listing threats but contextualizing their impact and likelihood. |
| **Tradeoff Identification** | Are key tradeoffs recognized and reasoned through? | Transparent discussion of competing priorities and deliberate risk choices. |
| **Architecture Artifacts** | Are diagrams or models included where appropriate? Are they clear and helpful? | Visuals should enhance understanding, even if simple. |
| **Security Recommendations** | Are the recommendations practical, risk-aligned, and prioritized? | Solutions should be feasible, scalable, and supportable. |
| **Communication Clarity** | Is the write-up professional, clear, and free from major gaps or assumptions? | Structured, readable, and business-aware explanations. |

| **Exemplary** | Demonstrates strong architectural reasoning, clear communication, thoughtful tradeoff management, and practical security alignment. Ready for professional portfolio presentation. |
| **Competent** | Adequately addresses major aspects of the challenge. Some minor gaps, but shows good security and design instincts. Ready for iteration and growth. |
| **Needs Improvement** | Gaps in understanding, reasoning, or communication. Good start but needs more depth or structure to meet professional expectations. |

*Security Architecture is a discipline of thinking and communicating, not just knowing. Clear articulation of risk, tradeoffs, and design choices is what transforms knowledge into leadership.*
