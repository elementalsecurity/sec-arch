# Challenge Response Template

This template provides a structured format for documenting responses to Security Architecture Portfolio Challenges.

Completing challenges with a consistent and professional structure strengthens your ability to communicate risk-based decisions, demonstrate structured reasoning, and build a credible portfolio.

---

## 1. Challenge Title

- **Challenge Name:**
- **Challenge Type:** (Foundational or Advanced)
- **Date Completed:**

---

## 2. System or Scenario Description

- **Briefly summarize the system, application, or problem you are addressing.**
- **Highlight any clarifying assumptions you are making about the environment, users, data, or goals.**

---

## 3. Architecture Artifacts

Attach or describe relevant artifacts:
- [ ] High-Level Architecture Diagram (recommended)
- [ ] Data Flow Diagram (optional)
- [ ] Trust Boundaries and Major Components

*(Use diagrams, visual models, or descriptive text if needed.)*

---

## 4. Threats and Risks Identified

- **List major threats or risks relevant to the system.**
- **Categorize by domain if helpful (e.g., Identity, Data, Network, Application, Cloud).**

| Threat / Risk | Domain | Potential Impact | Likelihood |
|:--------------|:-------|:-----------------|:-----------|
| Example: Unauthorized access to administrative portal | Identity | High | Medium |

*(Add more rows as needed.)*

---

## 5. Tradeoffs Considered

- **Describe any tradeoffs identified during design.**
- **Explain competing priorities and how you reasoned about risk vs usability, cost, performance, or other factors.**

| Tradeoff | Decision Made | Reasoning |
|:---------|:--------------|:----------|
| Example: Stricter MFA requirements vs customer friction | Gradual MFA rollout with incentives | Balanced security and user adoption needs |

---

## 6. Final Recommendations and Justifications

- **Summarize your final security architecture recommendations.**
- **Explain why your design choices strengthen security while balancing business needs.**
- **Highlight any residual risks and how they should be managed or monitored.**

---

*Documenting your challenge responses thoughtfully improves both your technical skills and your ability to reason, communicate, and lead as a future Security Architect.*
