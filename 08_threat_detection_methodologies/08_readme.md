# Threat Detection Methodologies

Threat detection is not just a technical function. It is an architectural discipline that requires structured models to understand adversary behavior, map attack paths, and guide defensive strategies.

This section introduces essential methodologies that help Security Architects design, evaluate, and evolve detection capabilities. Each model offers a different lens into how attacks unfold and how defenders can anticipate, disrupt, and contain them.

## Included Frameworks and Models

| Model | Focus Area |
|:------|:-----------|
| **Cyber Kill Chain** | Linear mapping of attack progression and defensive opportunities across the lifecycle |
| **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** | Relational analysis of adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim attributes |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** | Matrix of known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) |
| **MITRE D3FEND Framework** | Defensive technique knowledge graph mapped to adversarial behaviors |
| **Threat Hunting Maturity Model (THMM)** | Maturity model for proactive hunting and detection engineering programs |

Each file provides:
- Purpose and intended application
- Core structure and phases or relationships
- Integration points with security operations, detection engineering, and architecture
- Strengths, limitations, and strategic value

## How to Use These Models

- **For detection strategy:** Design security controls, telemetry, and analytics around known adversary behaviors.
- **For incident response:** Map alerts and investigations to threat models for context and escalation.
- **For threat hunting:** Develop hypotheses, pivoting strategies, and detection gaps informed by adversary actions.
- **For detection engineering:** Align SIEM, EDR, and SOAR workflows to adversary techniques and countermeasures.
- **For architectural planning:** Ensure monitoring, segmentation, and control placement is threat-informed and resilience-focused.

Mastery of detection methodologies transforms a security program from reactive alert handling into proactive, intelligence-driven defense.

*Threat detection is not about chasing logs. It is about anticipating behavior, designing resilience, and seeing attacks unfold before they succeed.*
