# Security Architecture Maturity Model Improvement Paths

Improving security architecture maturity is not about trying to leap from the lowest levels to the highest overnight. It is about making deliberate, achievable progress by building strong foundations and layering more advanced capabilities over time.

This document provides practical guidance for advancing maturity across each key domain.

## Improvement Path by Domain

### Governance and Strategy

**From Ad-hoc to Repeatable:**
- Assign clear ownership for security architecture responsibilities.
- Document initial security architecture guiding principles aligned with business goals.

**From Repeatable to Defined:**
- Establish formal governance processes including intake, review, and approval workflows.
- Communicate the security architecture strategy to all stakeholders.

**From Defined to Managed:**
- Measure the effectiveness of architecture governance processes.
- Integrate security architecture goals into enterprise and IT strategy plans.

**From Managed to Optimized:**
- Continuously refine governance models based on feedback, incidents, and evolving threats.
- Align architecture evolution with business innovation roadmaps.

---

### Architecture Design and Patterns

**From Ad-hoc to Repeatable:**
- Identify and document common secure design patterns.
- Conduct ad-hoc architecture reviews that include security input.

**From Repeatable to Defined:**
- Formalize a secure pattern library and make it accessible to teams.
- Integrate security architecture checkpoints into solution development lifecycles.

**From Defined to Managed:**
- Track adoption rates and effectiveness of secure patterns.
- Embed architecture risk tradeoff analysis into design documentation.

**From Managed to Optimized:**
- Evolve patterns based on emerging technology trends and attack techniques.
- Automate application of secure patterns through architecture tooling.

### Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis

**From Ad-hoc to Repeatable:**
- Introduce basic threat modeling activities for major projects.
- Use lightweight threat modeling methods and checklists.

**From Repeatable to Defined:**
- Train teams in structured threat modeling techniques like STRIDE.
- Build and maintain a shared threat library.

**From Defined to Managed:**
- Measure threat modeling coverage and impact on defect reduction.
- Align threat modeling outputs directly with risk management frameworks.

**From Managed to Optimized:**
- Automate parts of threat discovery and validation.
- Use threat modeling insights to proactively shape technology adoption and innovation.

### Secure-by-Design Enablement

**From Ad-hoc to Repeatable:**
- Document and communicate core secure design principles.
- Offer basic training or reference guides to development and operations teams.

**From Repeatable to Defined:**
- Embed secure design checkpoints into project initiation, review, and release processes.
- Define minimum secure configurations for platforms and services.

**From Defined to Managed:**
- Track adoption of secure design practices and configurations.
- Adjust standards based on incident root cause analysis and threat evolution.

**From Managed to Optimized:**
- Offer secure-by-design coaching embedded within project teams.
- Integrate secure defaults into platform as a service offerings.

---

### Architecture Tooling and Automation

**From Ad-hoc to Repeatable:**
- Introduce basic tooling for architecture diagramming and documentation.
- Pilot simple threat modeling tools.

**From Repeatable to Defined:**
- Standardize tooling choices and integrate them into development workflows.
- Document architecture artifacts in version-controlled repositories.

**From Defined to Managed:**
- Automate architecture validation checks in CI/CD pipelines.
- Link architecture artifacts to risk and compliance management systems.

**From Managed to Optimized:**
- Continuously refine and expand architecture automation.
- Integrate architecture insights into enterprise observability and telemetry platforms.

## Final Advice

- Focus first on strengthening Governance and Strategy if multiple domains are immature. Governance provides the foundation for sustainable growth.
- Emphasize visible, achievable wins early to build momentum.
- Mature iteratively. Small, consistent improvements accumulate into transformational capability.
