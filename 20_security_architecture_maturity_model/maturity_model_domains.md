# Security Architecture Maturity Model Domains

To fully assess and advance security architecture maturity, it is important to break down the discipline into distinct capability domains.

This document defines the key domains used in the Security Architecture Maturity Model.

---

## Key Capability Domains

### 1. Governance and Strategy

- **Focus:**
  - Establishing ownership, accountability, and strategic alignment for security architecture.
  - Defining policies, standards, and guiding principles.
  - Integrating security architecture into enterprise governance models.

- **Maturity Indicators:**
  - Existence of formal security architecture governance structures.
  - Alignment of security architecture objectives with business goals.
  - Consistent leadership sponsorship and visibility.

---

### 2. Architecture Design and Patterns

- **Focus:**
  - Defining and promoting reusable secure architecture patterns.
  - Embedding security requirements into solution and system designs.
  - Balancing security, usability, scalability, and operational needs.

- **Maturity Indicators:**
  - Availability and adoption of standard secure patterns and reference architectures.
  - Consistent inclusion of security architecture review in project lifecycles.
  - Risk-informed design decisions documented through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

---

### 3. Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis

- **Focus:**
  - Systematically identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats at design time.
  - Embedding threat modeling into solution development workflows.
  - Building and maintaining threat libraries for reuse.

- **Maturity Indicators:**
  - Threat modeling performed regularly and early in design phases.
  - Lightweight and formal threat modeling techniques scaled across teams.
  - Threat modeling outputs feed directly into risk mitigation and control design.

---

### 4. Secure-by-Design Enablement

- **Focus:**
  - Promoting secure design principles across architecture, development, and operations teams.
  - Shifting security left through secure defaults, security coaching, and early validation.

- **Maturity Indicators:**
  - Secure design checkpoints embedded in intake and review processes.
  - Training and tooling available to support secure-by-design practices.
  - Secure configurations and hardening practices standardized.

---

### 5. Architecture Tooling and Automation

- **Focus:**
  - Leveraging tools to support architecture modeling, validation, and documentation.
  - Automating repetitive tasks such as security requirement enforcement, threat identification, and control validation.

- **Maturity Indicators:**
  - Adoption of architecture modeling and security tooling.
  - Automation of security architecture validations in CI/CD workflows.
  - Integration between threat modeling, architecture review, and risk management systems.

*Security architecture maturity grows strongest when governance, design practices, threat thinking, enablement culture, and smart tooling advance together in a coordinated and deliberate way.*
