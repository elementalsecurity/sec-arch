# Security Architecture Maturity Model Levels

Maturity models provide structured ways to understand how capabilities evolve over time. In the context of security architecture, each level reflects increasing sophistication, consistency, and business alignment.

This document defines the maturity levels used in the Security Architecture Maturity Model.

---

## Maturity Levels Defined

### Level 1: Ad-hoc

- **Characteristics:**
  - Security architecture activities are reactive and inconsistent.
  - Design decisions often prioritize speed or cost over security.
  - No formal ownership of security architecture responsibilities.
  - Success depends heavily on individual heroics rather than organizational processes.

- **Risks:**
  - Frequent rework and technical debt.
  - High exposure to known and preventable threats.
  - Poor resilience against emerging risks.

---

### Level 2: Repeatable

- **Characteristics:**
  - Some security architecture activities are documented or informally standardized.
  - Key patterns and reference architectures begin to emerge.
  - Teams occasionally consult security during design, but involvement is inconsistent.
  - Roles and responsibilities are starting to form but may lack clarity.

- **Risks:**
  - Gaps in consistency and coverage.
  - Security activities depend heavily on individual teams' initiative.
  - Difficult to scale practices across the organization.

---

### Level 3: Defined

- **Characteristics:**
  - Security architecture processes are formally documented, approved, and communicated.
  - Standard design review checkpoints include security requirements.
  - Common architecture patterns and security principles are actively maintained.
  - Threat modeling practices are applied in a structured way.

- **Benefits:**
  - More predictable and repeatable security outcomes.
  - Easier onboarding of new projects and team members.
  - Improved stakeholder trust in architecture governance.

---

### Level 4: Managed

- **Characteristics:**
  - Security architecture performance and coverage are actively measured.
  - Metrics drive continuous improvement initiatives.
  - Architecture decisions consistently balance security, business needs, and operational efficiency.
  - Security architecture activities are integrated into broader enterprise architecture or solution delivery lifecycles.

- **Benefits:**
  - Strong alignment between security architecture and business priorities.
  - Measurable reduction in security incidents related to design flaws.
  - Security architecture becomes a competitive advantage.

---

### Level 5: Optimized

- **Characteristics:**
  - Security architecture practices are continuously improved through innovation, automation, and learning from incidents.
  - Advanced capabilities such as secure-by-design coaching, automated security validations, and proactive threat modeling are embedded across teams.
  - Security architecture is deeply integrated into digital transformation, product design, and strategic business planning.

- **Benefits:**
  - Highly resilient, adaptable systems.
  - Security enables faster innovation by minimizing redesign and rework.
  - Strong cultural integration of security principles at all organizational levels.

*Security architecture maturity is not a static achievement. It is a journey of increasing clarity, consistency, and contribution to organizational mission and resilience.*
