# Security Architecture Maturity Model Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is a critical step in understanding where your organization's security architecture practices stand today. This checklist provides a structured way to benchmark maturity across key domains and prioritize future improvements.

Use this assessment periodically to measure progress and guide strategic planning.

---

## How to Use This Self-Assessment

- Review each capability domain.
- For each statement, determine whether it is:
  - **Not Started**
  - **Partially Implemented**
  - **Fully Implemented**
- Focus on honest, evidence-based evaluations.
- Use results to identify strengths, gaps, and next-step priorities.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

### Governance and Strategy

| Capability | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Security architecture has clearly assigned ownership and accountability. |  |
| A formal security architecture strategy aligned with business goals exists. |  |
| Architecture decision-making integrates security considerations consistently. |  |
| Executive sponsorship supports security architecture initiatives. |  |

---

### Architecture Design and Patterns

| Capability | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Reusable secure architecture patterns are available and maintained. |  |
| Solution and system designs consistently incorporate security requirements. |  |
| Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are used to document key security tradeoffs. |  |
| Architecture review processes include mandatory security checkpoints. |  |

---

### Threat Modeling and Risk Analysis

| Capability | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Threat modeling is performed regularly for new and major system changes. |  |
| A threat library or structured threat catalog is available and used. |  |
| Threat modeling outputs drive prioritized security controls and mitigations. |  |
| Threat modeling practices are scalable across agile and DevOps workflows. |  |

---

### Secure-by-Design Enablement

| Capability | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Secure design principles are documented, communicated, and applied. |  |
| Secure defaults are enforced across system, platform, and service deployments. |  |
| Training or coaching is available to support secure architecture and design practices. |  |
| Secure design checkpoints are embedded in project intake and review processes. |  |

---

### Architecture Tooling and Automation

| Capability | Status |
|:-----------|:-------|
| Architecture modeling tools are used to represent systems and security considerations. |  |
| Threat modeling or security validation tools are integrated into workflows. |  |
| Security architecture validations are automated in CI/CD pipelines where appropriate. |  |
| Architecture artifacts are version-controlled and consistently updated. |  |

---

## Scoring Guidance (Optional)

| Status | Score |
|:-------|:------|
| Not Started | 0 |
| Partially Implemented | 1 |
| Fully Implemented | 2 |

- Calculate total scores by domain to prioritize areas for improvement.
- Focus first on raising weak domains before optimizing already strong areas.

*Self-assessment is not about judgment. It is about clarity and using that clarity to grow stronger, more resilient, and more aligned with the mission you serve.*
