# Security Architecture Maturity Model

Security architecture practices evolve over time as organizations grow in complexity, face new threats, and mature operationally. A structured maturity model helps architects and security leaders assess where they are today, define realistic goals, and chart a path forward.

This track introduces a Security Architecture Maturity Model focused on building resilient, defensible, and adaptive security architectures aligned with business needs.

---

## Purpose of This Track

- Define a clear maturity model for security architecture capabilities.
- Provide benchmarks for assessing current strengths and gaps.
- Guide organizations in prioritizing maturity improvements strategically.
- Help align technical security efforts with business, compliance, and operational priorities.

## What This Track Includes

| Document | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| **Maturity Model Levels** | Define each maturity level and its characteristics. |
| **Maturity Model Domains** | Break down maturity across key capability domains (e.g., Governance, Design, Threat Modeling, Tooling). |
| **Maturity Model Self-Assessment** | Provide a checklist-based tool for benchmarking current maturity. |
| **Maturity Model Improvement Paths** | Offer practical advice for advancing from one level to the next. |

Additional refinements or expansions may be added over time.

## Why a Security Architecture Maturity Model Matters

- **Benchmarking:** Provides a structured way to measure and communicate current capability levels.
- **Prioritization:** Helps focus limited resources on the most impactful improvements.
- **Roadmapping:** Supports multi-year planning aligned with business growth and threat evolution.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Gives non-technical stakeholders a clear view of where security architecture stands and where it is headed.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Embeds a growth mindset into security architecture programs.

Security architecture maturity is not about achieving perfection. It is about continuously improving the ability to design, build, and operate systems that are secure by design, resilient under pressure, and aligned to the mission they support.

*Security architecture is not a project. It is an evolving capability that grows stronger through deliberate practice, reflection, and adaptation.*
