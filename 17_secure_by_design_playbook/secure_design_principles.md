# Secure Design Principles

Effective security architecture is anchored in timeless design principles. These principles help architects reason through complex tradeoffs and ensure that systems are defensible, resilient, and trustworthy from the beginning.

This document defines core Secure-by-Design principles that apply across all domains, technologies, and environments.

## Core Secure Design Principles

### 1. Least Privilege

Grant users, services, and processes the minimum set of permissions necessary to perform their functions — nothing more.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces the blast radius of credential or service compromise.
- Limits attacker movement and privilege escalation opportunities.

**Examples:**
- Assign fine-grained IAM roles instead of broad administrative rights.
- Separate read, write, and delete permissions for data resources.

---

### 2. Defense in Depth

Layer multiple, independent security controls so that failure of one does not lead to total compromise.

**Why it matters:**
- No single control is foolproof.
- Compounded defenses buy time for detection and response.

**Examples:**
- Combine endpoint security, network segmentation, identity verification, and behavioral monitoring.
- Require authentication at both application and API layers.

---

### 3. Fail Secure

Systems should fail in a secure state, denying access or functionality rather than defaulting to insecure behavior when errors occur.

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents attackers from exploiting system failure modes.
- Ensures continuity of security assumptions even during outages.

**Examples:**
- Authentication systems deny access if the identity provider cannot be reached.
- Data access systems block retrieval if encryption keys are unavailable.

---

### 4. Assume Breach

Design systems with the mindset that attackers may already be inside or will inevitably gain access.

**Why it matters:**
- Encourages proactive containment, detection, and resilience planning.
- Reduces reliance on perimeter defenses alone.

**Examples:**
- Implement micro-segmentation and east-west traffic monitoring.
- Monitor internal system interactions with the same scrutiny as external ones.

---

### 5. Minimal Trust Assumptions

Minimize assumptions about the trustworthiness of users, devices, services, and networks.

**Why it matters:**
- Trust relationships are prime targets for exploitation.
- Explicit verification improves security posture across distributed environments.

**Examples:**
- Authenticate and authorize every API call, even internal ones.
- Require device compliance checks before granting access to sensitive systems.

---

### 6. Secure Defaults

Design systems to be secure out of the box, with minimal user configuration required to achieve a secure state.

**Why it matters:**
- Many breaches occur because default settings are insecure.
- Reduces user error and misconfiguration risks.

**Examples:**
- Ship applications with secure transport (HTTPS) enabled by default.
- Set least privilege roles as the default for new cloud resources.

---

### 7. Visibility and Auditability

Design systems so that security events are observable, attributable, and verifiable.

**Why it matters:**
- Detection, investigation, and compliance all depend on visibility.
- Attackers thrive in blind spots.

**Examples:**
- Log authentication attempts, privilege escalations, and sensitive data accesses.
- Correlate events across systems for holistic security analysis.

*Secure architecture is not built solely by applying tools or policies. It is forged by deliberately applying principles that resist compromise, minimize impact, and enable continuous trust evaluation.*
