# Integrating Threat Modeling into Design

Threat modeling is the structured practice of identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and security weaknesses in a system during the design phase. Integrating threat modeling into architecture workflows ensures that designs are proactively hardened against attack rather than reactively patched after deployment.

This document outlines practical strategies for embedding lightweight, scalable threat modeling into Secure-by-Design practices.

## Why Integrate Threat Modeling into Design?

- **Early Risk Detection:** Surface vulnerabilities and design weaknesses before they are expensive or difficult to fix.
- **Better Security Decisions:** Make tradeoffs and architecture choices with a clear view of attacker opportunities and system weaknesses.
- **Improved Resilience:** Build systems that anticipate and withstand real-world attack techniques.
- **Compliance Alignment:** Many standards (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST) require documented risk assessments and threat analyses.

## Lightweight Threat Modeling Process

For most projects, a lightweight approach is sufficient to drive Secure-by-Design outcomes without overwhelming teams.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the System Scope:**
   - Clarify the system boundaries, components, data flows, and external integrations.

2. **Identify Threat Actors and Objectives:**
   - Determine who might attack the system and what they would aim to achieve (e.g., data theft, service disruption).

3. **Enumerate Potential Threats:**
   - Apply structured thinking models like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to identify possible attacks.

4. **Analyze Risk Impact and Likelihood:**
   - Prioritize threats based on their potential impact and the feasibility of exploitation.

5. **Define and Prioritize Mitigations:**
   - Map proposed controls or design changes to the identified threats.
   - Prioritize mitigations that address the highest-risk threats first.

6. **Document and Review:**
   - Keep records of identified threats, risk rankings, and mitigation strategies.
   - Integrate threat modeling outputs into architecture review processes.

## Integrating Threat Modeling into Secure Design Checkpoints

| Design Phase | Threat Modeling Focus |
|:-------------|:----------------------|
| Project Intake | Identify high-risk assets and threat actors early. |
| High-Level Architecture | Map trust boundaries and high-level threat categories. |
| Detailed Solution Design | Identify specific attack vectors against components and integrations. |
| Pre-Implementation Review | Validate that mitigations are reflected in implementation plans. |
| Post-Implementation Validation | Confirm that threat mitigations are active and effective. |

## Threat Modeling Tips for Architects

- Focus on threats that matter: prioritize based on real business and technical risk.
- Keep it iterative: refine the model as designs evolve, rather than treating it as a one-time document.
- Engage cross-functional teams: developers, operations, compliance, and product management all have valuable perspectives.
- Use visuals: simple data flow diagrams (DFDs) and threat matrices improve communication and understanding.
- Reuse and adapt: leverage existing threat libraries and patterns to speed up analysis.

*Threat modeling is not about predicting every possible attack. It is about thinking like an attacker, identifying weaknesses before they are exploited, and shaping systems that are harder to break.*
