# Secure Architecture Patterns Overview

Secure architecture patterns provide reusable, proven solutions to common security design challenges. By adopting established patterns, architects can accelerate design work, improve consistency, and reduce the likelihood of missing critical controls.

This document introduces the concept of secure architecture patterns and highlights how they fit into a Secure-by-Design approach.

## What Are Secure Architecture Patterns?

Secure architecture patterns are standardized approaches to designing systems, components, and interactions that embed security requirements from the outset.

**Characteristics of a Secure Architecture Pattern:**
- Addresses a recurring security design problem.
- Provides a generalized solution adaptable to specific contexts.
- Embeds Secure-by-Design principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, and minimal trust assumptions.
- Includes clear tradeoffs and limitations.

## Why Use Secure Architecture Patterns?

- **Consistency:** Apply uniform security controls across projects and teams.
- **Efficiency:** Save time by building on well-understood, documented security models.
- **Risk Reduction:** Reduce reliance on ad-hoc, error-prone security implementations.
- **Governance:** Support architectural governance with standardized security templates.
- **Scalability:** Enable secure system design even as organizational complexity grows.

## Examples of Secure Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| Identity Federation Pattern | Enable secure cross-domain authentication and authorization. |
| API Gateway Security Pattern | Protect APIs through centralized traffic control, authentication, and rate limiting. |
| Secrets Management Pattern | Secure sensitive credentials, keys, and tokens across their lifecycle. |
| Cloud Segmentation Pattern | Isolate workloads and minimize the blast radius of cloud compromises. |
| Zero Trust Access Pattern | Enforce adaptive, least-privilege access regardless of network location. |
| Secure Service Mesh Pattern | Protect microservice communication through mutual TLS and fine-grained authorization. |
| Data Protection Pattern | Secure sensitive data at rest, in transit, and in use. |
| Privileged Access Management Pattern | Control, monitor, and limit the use of administrative privileges. |
| Secure Software Supply Chain Pattern | Protect the integrity of code, build processes, and deployment pipelines. |

(Refer to Track 16 for detailed documentation of each pattern.)

## How to Apply Secure Architecture Patterns

1. **Identify Relevance:**
   - During project intake or solution design, identify applicable patterns based on risk and architectural needs.

2. **Adapt to Context:**
   - Tailor the generalized pattern to specific technologies, organizational policies, and threat models.

3. **Document Customizations:**
   - Capture any deviations from the base pattern and justify them clearly.

4. **Integrate with Design Checkpoints:**
   - Embed pattern adoption verification into Secure Design Checkpoints and architecture reviews.

5. **Review and Evolve Patterns:**
   - Update and refine internal pattern libraries based on lessons learned, new threats, and emerging technologies.

*Secure architecture patterns bridge the gap between abstract principles and real-world system design. They transform security from theory into structured, repeatable, and defensible practice.*
