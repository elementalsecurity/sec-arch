# Security Testing Tools and Technologies

This document outlines the tools and platforms used to identify vulnerabilities across applications and systems through static, dynamic, interactive, and manual testing. Security testing is a core capability for identifying and remediating risk in software, APIs, web applications, and infrastructure before exploitation.

---

## Strategic Objectives

- Detect vulnerabilities in code, configurations, and deployments
- Validate resilience against OWASP Top 10 and common exploit vectors
- Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines
- Ensure regulatory and compliance readiness
- Support DevSecOps with actionable, developer-friendly feedback

## Core Categories of Security Testing Tools

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries for coding flaws without executing the program.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Semgrep** | Lightweight static analyzer with rule-as-code customization |
| **SonarQube** | Code quality platform with vulnerability scanning and CI/CD plugins |
| **Checkmarx** | Commercial enterprise-grade SAST for multiple languages |
| **Fortify (Micro Focus)** | Deep static analysis and enterprise policy enforcement |
| **Veracode Static Analysis** | Cloud-based scanner with IDE and CI/CD integrations |

---

### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
Examines running applications for vulnerabilities exposed during execution.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **OWASP ZAP** | Open-source proxy-based scanner for web apps |
| **Burp Suite Pro** | Manual and automated testing, scanner, repeater, and extender |
| **Acunetix / Invicti (formerly Netsparker)** | Commercial web app vulnerability scanners for scalable DAST integration |
| **AppSpider / WebInspect** | DAST tools often used in compliance and enterprise testing workflows |

---

### 3. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
Combines SAST and DAST by instrumenting the application at runtime to monitor code execution and behavior.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Contrast Security** | Agent-based instrumentation for runtime vulnerability detection |
| **Seeker (Synopsys)** | IAST with DevOps integration and contextual vulnerability tracing |

---

### 4. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
Analyzes third-party libraries and open-source components for known vulnerabilities.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Snyk** | Developer-focused SCA with container and IaC scanning |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Open-source CVE scanner for dependencies |
| **Black Duck / FOSSA / Mend.io** | License compliance and vulnerability management for OSS dependencies |

---

### 5. Container and Infrastructure Testing

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Trivy** | Scanner for container images, file systems, and Git repos |
| **Clair** | Vulnerability static analysis for OCI images |
| **Kube-Bench / Kube-Hunter** | Kubernetes configuration and security posture analysis |
| **Terrascan / Checkov / tfsec** | IaC security scanning tools for Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes YAML

---

### 6. Penetration Testing and Red Teaming

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Metasploit Framework** | Exploit development and post-exploitation toolkit |
| **Cobalt Strike** | Commercial red team platform for payloads, beacons, and C2 simulation |
| **Nmap** | Network discovery and port scanning utility with scripting engine |
| **Burp Suite Pro** | Extensively used in manual web app pentests |
| **Impacket / CrackMapExec / BloodHound** | AD-focused tools used in internal assessments

---

## Design Considerations for Security Architects

- Select tools that integrate into CI/CD pipelines and developer IDEs
- Enable testing at multiple layers: code, dependencies, containers, infrastructure
- Evaluate licensing models (open source vs. commercial) for scaling across teams
- Ensure tools support regulatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO)
- Include testing results in risk registers and vulnerability management workflows

---

## Summary

Security testing tools help uncover weaknesses before adversaries can exploit them. Security Architects must enable testing coverage across the SDLC using a balanced mix of automated tools and manual validation. Integrating these tools into DevSecOps workflows ensures that vulnerabilities are identified, tracked, and remediated early in the lifecycle, improving security posture while reducing cost and complexity of fixes.
