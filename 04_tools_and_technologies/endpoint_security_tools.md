# Endpoint Security Tools and Technologies

This document outlines the tools and platforms that Security Architects must consider when designing endpoint security strategies. As endpoints are a primary attack surface in modern enterprises, robust controls are required to protect, detect, and respond to threats across workstations, servers, and mobile devices.

---

## Strategic Objectives

- Prevent malware, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Detect anomalous or malicious activity in real time
- Enable rapid response and containment of endpoint-based incidents
- Enforce compliance and control across diverse device fleets

## Core Categories of Endpoint Security

### 1. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR solutions provide real-time monitoring, behavioral detection, and forensic capabilities for endpoints.

| Tool | Features |
|------|----------|
| **CrowdStrike Falcon** | Cloud-native EDR/XDR, threat intelligence, real-time response |
| **SentinelOne Singularity** | AI-driven detection, rollback capabilities, automation-ready |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** | Native integration with Windows, threat analytics, attack surface reduction |
| **Sophos Intercept X** | Exploit prevention, deep learning-based detection |
| **Trend Micro Apex One** | Integrated endpoint protection and detection with central visibility |

### 2. Antivirus / Next-Gen AV (NGAV)
Traditional and modern AV engines that block known malware and use heuristics or machine learning.

- Bitdefender GravityZone
- Kaspersky Endpoint Security
- Norton/Symantec Endpoint Protection
- McAfee Endpoint Security
- Malwarebytes EDR

While many NGAV products are integrated into EDR platforms, some organizations layer both for risk reduction.

### 3. Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Endpoint Management
Manage configuration, patching, and compliance of mobile and desktop endpoints.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Microsoft Intune** | Unified endpoint management, compliance policies, mobile app control |
| **VMware Workspace ONE** | Cross-platform MDM, identity management, zero trust enforcement |
| **Jamf Pro** | Apple device management with security and patching workflows |
| **Cisco Meraki Systems Manager** | MDM for small to mid-sized fleets |

### 4. Endpoint Hardening and Configuration
- **CIS-CAT Pro**: Scans endpoints against CIS Benchmarks
- **Lynis**: Unix-based auditing and hardening tool
- **Windows Security Baseline**: Microsoft-recommended GPO baselines
- **macOS Security Compliance Project**: Apple hardening guides

---

### 5. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Velociraptor**: Open-source DFIR agent and remote investigation toolkit
- **GRR Rapid Response**: Remote live forensics framework
- **KAPE**: Triage collection tool by Red Canary for rapid disk and memory analysis
- **Autopsy**: Digital forensics GUI based on Sleuth Kit

---

## Design Considerations for Security Architects

- **Platform diversity**: Ensure tools cover Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile where applicable
- **Visibility**: Prefer tools that offer behavioral telemetry, timeline reconstruction, and cloud-based enrichment
- **Containment**: Select platforms that allow remote isolation, process killing, and remediation workflows
- **Integrations**: Evaluate compatibility with SIEM, SOAR, and identity systems
- **Policy enforcement**: Use endpoint tools for patch compliance, configuration enforcement, and data protection

---

## Summary

Endpoint security tools are essential to defending users and workloads against modern threats. Security Architects must evaluate EDR, NGAV, MDM, and DFIR tools not only for detection and response capabilities, but also for their integration with broader security architecture. The right combination of prevention, visibility, and control enables scalable and effective endpoint protection strategies.
