# Secure DevOps Tools and Technologies

This document provides a structured overview of the tools and platforms that support **Secure DevOps** practices commonly referred to as **DevSecOps**. Security Architects play a critical role in integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that code, pipelines, secrets, and infrastructure are secure by design.

---

## Strategic Objectives

- Shift security left into development pipelines
- Secure secrets and credentials used across CI/CD and IaC
- Detect vulnerabilities in source code, containers, and infrastructure
- Automate compliance and policy enforcement within pipelines
- Promote collaboration between development, security, and operations

## Core Categories of Secure DevOps Tooling

### 1. Secrets Management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HashiCorp Vault** | Dynamic secrets, encryption-as-a-service, identity-based access |
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Secure storage and rotation of credentials and API keys |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Secure secrets and certificate management with RBAC integration |
| **GCP Secret Manager** | IAM-controlled secret versioning and audit logging |
| **Doppler / Akeyless / CyberArk Conjur** | Secrets orchestration and DevOps integration

Design Consideration: Centralize secrets, enable audit logging, rotate automatically, and enforce least privilege access.

### 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Semgrep** | Lightweight, customizable static analyzer with CI/CD integration |
| **SonarQube** | Code quality and security scanning with IDE and pipeline support |
| **Checkmarx / Fortify / Veracode** | Enterprise-grade SAST tools with policy enforcement |

SAST should be integrated early in the pipeline and during pull requests.

### 3. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Snyk** | Dependency scanning for open-source and container vulnerabilities |
| **OWASP Dependency-Check** | Open-source tool to identify known CVEs in dependencies |
| **Black Duck / FOSSA / Mend.io** | Commercial SCA tools with license compliance tracking

---

### 4. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **OWASP ZAP** | Open-source dynamic scanner for web application vulnerabilities |
| **Burp Suite Pro** | Manual and automated dynamic testing toolkit |
| **Acunetix / Invicti** | Commercial web vulnerability scanners for CI/CD automation

---

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Checkov / tfsec / Terrascan** | Scan Terraform, CloudFormation, Helm for security misconfigurations |
| **Bridgecrew / Snyk IaC** | Cloud-first tools with GitOps integration and policy-as-code |
| **KICS** | Open-source IaC scanner by Checkmarx with broad format support

---

### 6. Container and Kubernetes Security

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Trivy** | Vulnerability scanner for containers, IaC, and Git repositories |
| **Aqua Security / Prisma Cloud** | Full CNAPP platforms covering container scanning and runtime protection |
| **Falco** | CNCF project for real-time behavioral detection on Kubernetes nodes |
| **Kubescape** | Policy compliance and risk assessment for Kubernetes workloads

---

## Secure Pipeline Integration Points

- Git Hooks: Pre-commit and pre-push checks
- CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps
- Artifact Repositories: Scan and sign packages in JFrog Artifactory or GitHub Packages
- Container Registries: Scan OCI images before deployment (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, ACR)

---

## Design Considerations for Security Architects

- Select tools that support **automation and GitOps workflows**
- Use **policy-as-code** to enforce security gates across pipelines
- Integrate security tooling into **developer-friendly environments** (IDEs, pull requests)
- Track **compliance drift** between development, staging, and production environments
- Align pipeline controls with **threat modeling and data classification**

---

## Summary

Secure DevOps practices require intentional architectural planning and effective tool integration. By embedding security into the development workflow, across code, dependencies, infrastructure, and runtime environmentsâ€”Security Architects can help organizations deliver software faster, more securely, and with continuous assurance.
