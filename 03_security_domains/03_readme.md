# 03 Security Domains

Security Architecture is not a monolith. It is an interconnected system of specialized domains, each addressing distinct risks, threats, and design considerations.

This section introduces the **core security domains** every Security Architect must master. These domains represent the functional building blocks of modern security architecture. A skilled architect not only understands each domain individually but also designs solutions that bridge and reinforce them collectively.

Strong security architecture connects domains into cohesive systems where identity protects data, network segmentation supports cloud resilience, and governance ensures operational transparency.

## Purpose of This Section

- Define the major domains of Security Architecture.
- Explain the scope, risks, and design principles of each domain.
- Highlight the interdependencies across domains.
- Provide a foundation for cross-domain architectural thinking.

## What You Will Learn

| Domain | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | Design secure authentication, authorization, and access governance across systems and users. |
| **Infrastructure Security** | Protect foundational compute, storage, and hypervisor layers that host modern applications. |
| **Network Security** | Architect secure network topologies, segmentation models, and communication protections. |
| **Application Security** | Build security directly into software development, deployment, and operations lifecycles. |
| **Cloud Security** | Address cloud-native risks, shared responsibility models, and multi-cloud design patterns. |
| **Compliance and Governance** | Align security design with regulatory frameworks, organizational policies, and auditability requirements. |
| **Data Security and Privacy** | Protect sensitive data across its lifecycle with encryption, classification, and privacy controls. |
| **Endpoint Security** | Secure user devices, mobile assets, and edge systems against compromise and misuse. |

## How to Use This Section

- Study each domain individually to build specialized knowledge.
- Cross-reference domains to understand architectural intersections.
- Use domain knowledge to design layered, defense-in-depth architectures.
- Apply these foundations during architecture reviews, maturity assessments, and strategic planning.

> "Mastering domains is not about dividing security into silos. It is about weaving them into a resilient fabric that strengthens everything it touches."

*Security Architecture excellence comes from thinking across domains, designing at intersections, and always building toward unified resilience.*
