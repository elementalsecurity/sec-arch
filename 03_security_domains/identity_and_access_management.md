# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the backbone of secure architecture. It ensures that only authorized users and systems can access the right resources at the right times, for the right reasons.

Strong IAM design is critical because identity is often the first target in modern attack chains. Weak authentication, poor authorization logic, and unmanaged credentials can enable attackers to bypass even the strongest network or endpoint defenses.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to IAM principles, risks, architectures, and best practices.

## Purpose of IAM

- Verify user, device, and system identities reliably.
- Enforce least privilege access to systems, applications, and data.
- Govern authentication, authorization, and auditing consistently across the environment.
- Support business agility while minimizing security risks.

## Core Components of IAM

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Authentication** | Verifying the identity of a user or system through credentials, tokens, biometrics, or certificates. |
| **Authorization** | Granting or denying access to resources based on identities, roles, attributes, or policies. |
| **Account Lifecycle Management** | Provisioning, modifying, and deprovisioning user and system accounts throughout their lifecycle. |
| **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** | Controlling and monitoring access to high-risk administrative accounts and functions. |
| **Audit and Monitoring** | Capturing identity events for visibility, forensic analysis, and compliance reporting. |

---

## Common IAM Risks

- Weak password policies and authentication mechanisms.
- Unmanaged accounts, especially orphaned or dormant accounts.
- Overprivileged users violating the principle of least privilege.
- Insecure credential storage or transmission.
- Lack of visibility into access activities and entitlement drift.

## IAM Design Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary access rights.
- **Separation of Duties (SoD):** Prevent individuals from having conflicting responsibilities that enable abuse.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Reduce credential sprawl and authentication fatigue without weakening security.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require additional verification factors beyond passwords.
- **Zero Trust Identity:** Continuously validate identity and context for every access request.
- **Just-in-Time Access:** Grant elevated permissions only when needed and for a limited time.
- **Federation and Identity Brokering:** Enable secure, standardized authentication across organizational boundaries.

## IAM Architectures

| Architecture Model | Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| **Centralized IAM** | A single authoritative identity provider (IdP) governs authentication and authorization across systems. |
| **Federated IAM** | Separate identity providers interoperate securely through standards like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect. |
| **Decentralized IAM (Self-Sovereign Identity)** | Emerging models where users control their identities without relying on centralized authorities. |

## Best Practices for Building IAM Systems

- Use strong, phishing-resistant authentication methods (e.g., FIDO2, WebAuthn).
- Enforce MFA for all privileged and remote access accounts.
- Regularly review and right-size access permissions based on roles and risk profiles.
- Automate account provisioning and deprovisioning workflows to prevent orphaned accounts.
- Monitor and alert on anomalous authentication or authorization events.
- Protect all credentials and secrets using secure vaulting solutions.
- Design IAM processes to scale across hybrid, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments.

---

## IAM Metrics to Monitor

- Number of orphaned or inactive accounts.
- Percentage of users with MFA enabled.
- Privileged account usage trends.
- Time to revoke access after employment termination.
- Authentication failure rates and trends.
- Audit completeness and event retention periods.

*Identity is the new perimeter. Strong IAM design does not just protect access. It protects trust, integrity, and resilience across the entire digital ecosystem.*
