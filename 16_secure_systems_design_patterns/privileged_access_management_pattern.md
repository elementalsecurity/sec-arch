# Privileged Access Management (PAM) Pattern

## Problem Description

Privileged accounts provide administrative control over critical systems, infrastructure, and data. They are prime targets for attackers seeking to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and move laterally across environments. Without strong governance, privileged access sprawl, credential reuse, and poor session management create serious risks.

The challenge is to secure, monitor, and control privileged access consistently across all environments without creating operational bottlenecks or administrative friction.

## Secure Design Solution

The Privileged Access Management Pattern establishes centralized control, auditing, and risk reduction mechanisms around privileged accounts and sessions.

**Core Elements:**
- **Centralized Privileged Account Vault:** Secure storage and management of privileged credentials with strong encryption.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access:** Grant elevated privileges only when needed and for the shortest duration required.
- **Session Recording and Monitoring:** Capture and monitor privileged sessions to enable real-time oversight and forensic analysis.
- **Credential Rotation:** Automatically rotate privileged account credentials on a regular basis, and immediately after use when possible.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement:** Minimize the number of privileged accounts and reduce privileges to the minimum necessary scope.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require strong authentication mechanisms for all privileged access.

**Typical Flow:**
1. User requests privileged access through an access management workflow.
2. Approval is validated based on role, context, and policy.
3. Access is granted temporarily through the PAM system.
4. All session activities are recorded and monitored.
5. Access rights expire automatically when no longer needed.
6. Credentials are rotated immediately after use if static credentials are involved.

## Tradeoffs and Considerations

| Tradeoff | Consideration |
|:---------|:--------------|
| **Operational Agility vs Security Control** | Strong PAM controls can introduce delays if not well-integrated. Prioritize automation, pre-approved workflows, and integration with existing ITSM systems. |
| **Cost vs Risk Reduction** | Enterprise-grade PAM solutions can be expensive. Prioritize coverage for high-risk assets and critical systems first. |
| **User Friction vs Adoption** | If PAM processes are too cumbersome, users may seek workarounds. Streamline workflows and integrate with SSO and MFA providers. |
| **Cloud and Hybrid Compatibility** | PAM must support cloud-native services and hybrid environments. Choose solutions that integrate across on-premises and cloud ecosystems. |

## Implementation Notes

- Common PAM platforms include CyberArk, BeyondTrust, HashiCorp Vault (with appropriate modules), and cloud-native offerings like AWS Secrets Manager with session recording.
- Enforce approval workflows and access policies through IAM or access request platforms.
- Configure alerting for unusual privileged session behaviors (e.g., access outside business hours, excessive commands).
- Regularly audit privileged account inventories, access rights, and session recordings.
- Train administrators and engineers on secure privileged access practices.
- Integrate PAM with SIEM and security orchestration systems for incident detection and response.

*Privileged access is not just an IT operational matter. It is a primary control point for organizational survival during attacks. Securing it is essential, continuous, and non-negotiable.*
