# Secure Systems Design Patterns

Security Architecture is not only about frameworks and risk management. It is also about building secure systems efficiently and consistently.

Secure Design Patterns provide reusable solutions to common security design challenges. They help architects:
- Avoid reinventing the wheel
- Apply proven security principles
- Design systems that are defensible, resilient, and scalable
- Document rationale and tradeoffs clearly

This track introduces a curated library of secure system design patterns across key domains.



## Purpose of This Track

- Provide structured, reusable design patterns that can be adapted across projects
- Reinforce security principles such as least privilege, separation of duties, and defense in depth
- Help architects reason about tradeoffs and operational impacts of different designs
- Support faster, more consistent secure architecture reviews and project designs



## What This Track Includes

Each design pattern will include:
- **Problem Description:** The architectural problem or risk being addressed
- **Secure Design Solution:** Structured design elements that solve the problem
- **Tradeoffs and Considerations:** Real-world impacts of adopting the pattern
- **Optional Diagram:** Visual representation of the pattern
- **Implementation Notes:** Practical tips for deploying the pattern at different scales



## Planned Design Pattern Documents

| Pattern | Description |
|:--|:|
| Identity Federation Pattern | Securely federating identity across multiple domains or organizations |
| API Gateway Security Pattern | Protecting APIs using secure gateway architectures |
| Secrets Management Pattern | Storing, accessing, and rotating sensitive secrets securely |
| Cloud Segmentation Pattern | Structuring cloud environments with security zones and isolation |
| Zero Trust Access Pattern | Designing access models where no implicit trust is given based on network location |

Additional patterns may be added over time.



*Secure systems are not built from scratch every time. They are composed deliberately from well-understood, well-reasoned building blocks. Design patterns make good architecture repeatable.*
