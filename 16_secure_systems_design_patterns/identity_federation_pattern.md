# Identity Federation Pattern

## Problem Description

Organizations often need to securely authenticate users across different administrative domains without duplicating identities. This is common in mergers and acquisitions, partner integrations, supply chain ecosystems, or multi-cloud environments. Poorly implemented federation can introduce trust vulnerabilities, identity sprawl, and authorization inconsistencies.

The challenge is to enable seamless, secure, scalable authentication and authorization across domains while minimizing risk exposure.

## Secure Design Solution

The Identity Federation Pattern establishes trust between identity providers (IdPs) across different domains by using standardized protocols such as SAML, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or WS-Federation.

**Core Elements:**
- **Trust Establishment:** Explicit trust relationships defined between IdPs and service providers (SPs).
- **Standardized Assertions:** Identity claims and attributes are exchanged using secure, standardized formats.
- **Minimal Privilege Propagation:** Only necessary attributes and minimal entitlements are shared.
- **Strong Authentication at Source:** Authentication responsibility remains with the user's home organization.
- **Assertion Integrity and Confidentiality:** Digital signatures and secure transport ensure assertion validity and confidentiality.
- **Centralized Authorization Control:** Service providers enforce access policies based on trusted assertions.

**Typical Flow:**
1. User attempts to access a service at SP.
2. SP redirects the user to their home IdP for authentication.
3. IdP authenticates the user and issues a signed assertion.
4. SP consumes the assertion, validates the signature, and grants access based on provided claims.

## Tradeoffs and Considerations

| Tradeoff | Consideration |
|:---------|:--------------|
| **Simplicity vs Flexibility** | Pre-establishing trust between a few known IdPs simplifies management but limits scalability to unknown partners. Federation brokers or hub models can address this. |
| **Attribute Minimization vs Rich Authorization** | Sharing only essential identity attributes protects privacy but may limit fine-grained authorization capabilities. Balance must be carefully tuned. |
| **Source Authentication Quality** | The strength of the entire model depends on how well home organizations authenticate their users. Weak authentication undermines federation. |
| **Incident Containment** | Federation trust links organizations. If one IdP is compromised, downstream services could be at risk if controls are not properly scoped. Trust should be scoped narrowly and monitored. |

## Implementation Notes

- Prefer modern, widely adopted protocols such as OIDC for new implementations.
- Scope federation permissions narrowly to specific applications and attribute sets.
- Validate assertions rigorously, including signature verification and audience restrictions.
- Monitor authentication events and assertion consumption logs for anomaly detection.
- Regularly reassess federation relationships, especially with external partners.

*Identity Federation, when designed carefully, enables organizations to collaborate securely without surrendering control over their user populations. Trust must be deliberate, bounded, and continuously monitored.*
