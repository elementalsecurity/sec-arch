# Zero Trust Access Pattern

## Problem Description

Traditional network security models rely on the assumption that everything inside the network perimeter is trustworthy. In modern environments, where users, devices, applications, and workloads operate across diverse locations and platforms, this assumption no longer holds. Trust based on network location exposes systems to lateral movement attacks, insider threats, and supply chain compromises.

The challenge is to design access controls that authenticate and authorize every request based on identity, context, and policy, regardless of network location.

## Secure Design Solution

The Zero Trust Access Pattern enforces the principle "never trust, always verify" by requiring explicit, adaptive authentication and authorization for all access requests.

**Core Elements:**
- **Strong Identity Assurance:** Authenticate users, devices, applications, and services with verified identities.
- **Context-Aware Policies:** Factor context such as device posture, location, risk signals, and session anomalies into access decisions.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Grant only the minimum access required, for the minimum time necessary.
- **Micro-Segmentation:** Restrict lateral movement within systems through granular access control at the workload or application level.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Reevaluate trust continuously based on telemetry and behavior.
- **Encrypted Communications:** Require end-to-end encryption for all sessions, internal and external.

**Typical Flow:**
1. A user or service attempts to access a resource.
2. Access request triggers strong identity authentication.
3. Contextual information about the request is evaluated.
4. Access is granted only if all policy conditions are met.
5. Access is continuously monitored, and trust can be revoked dynamically.

## Tradeoffs and Considerations

| Tradeoff | Consideration |
|:---------|:--------------|
| **User Experience vs Security Rigor** | Contextual access decisions can introduce friction. Invest in adaptive authentication to minimize unnecessary challenges. |
| **Cost vs Coverage** | Comprehensive identity and posture telemetry can drive costs. Prioritize high-value assets and high-risk access paths first. |
| **Legacy System Compatibility** | Some legacy systems are difficult to integrate into Zero Trust models. Bridge solutions or phased retirement may be necessary. |
| **Operational Complexity** | Policy management, telemetry integration, and trust reevaluation introduce operational challenges. Automation and clear governance processes are critical. |

## Implementation Notes

- Start with clear identification of protected assets and critical access paths.
- Deploy centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Device Management platforms.
- Implement Conditional Access policies that adapt based on real-time signals.
- Leverage Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) everywhere.
- Use identity-aware proxies, secure access brokers, or Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) technologies to abstract access away from physical network topology.
- Continuously monitor access patterns and adjust policies based on new threats and business changes.

*Zero Trust is not a product or a switch to flip. It is an operating model that treats security as an adaptive, continuous process anchored in identity, context, and verification.*
