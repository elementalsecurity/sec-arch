# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is the structured process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential threats to a system before they can be exploited. It allows Security Architects to anticipate attacks proactively and design defenses that are risk-driven and context-aware.

Threat modeling is not a one-time checklist. It is a mindset and a continuous practice that must evolve with the system and threat landscape.

This document provides a deep and operational guide to threat modeling in modern security architecture.

## Purpose of Threat Modeling

- Identify vulnerabilities and risks early in the design phase
- Prioritize mitigations based on realistic threat scenarios
- Inform secure design decisions with adversarial thinking
- Create living documentation of system risks and defenses

## Core Elements of Threat Modeling

| Element | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Assets** | Identify what needs to be protected, such as data, systems, services, and trust boundaries. |
| **Actors** | Define internal and external actors who might interact with or attack the system. |
| **Attack Vectors** | Analyze how threats could exploit vulnerabilities or design flaws. |
| **Security Controls** | Map existing or proposed defenses to identified threats. |
| **Risk Assessment** | Prioritize threats based on likelihood, impact, and business context. |

## Common Threat Modeling Methodologies

| Methodology | Focus Area |
|:------------|:-----------|
| **STRIDE** | Categorizes threats as Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. |
| **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** | Risk-centric threat modeling based on attacker capabilities, asset value, and attack likelihood. |
| **Trike** | Threat modeling focused on risk management and defining acceptable risk levels. |
| **OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)** | Organizational risk-focused approach suitable for larger ecosystems. |

## Threat Modeling Process

1. **Define Scope and Objectives**
   - Understand business goals, compliance requirements, and technical boundaries.
2. **Decompose the System**
   - Create Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) showing processes, data stores, and trust boundaries.
3. **Identify Threats**
   - Apply a structured methodology like STRIDE to find potential threats.
4. **Assess Risks**
   - Evaluate threat likelihood and impact to prioritize.
5. **Define and Map Controls**
   - Propose mitigations and security controls for each prioritized threat.
6. **Review and Validate**
   - Collaborate with engineering, operations, and business stakeholders to validate assumptions.
7. **Maintain and Update**
   - Evolve the threat model as the system changes or new threats emerge.

## Common Threat Modeling Pitfalls

- Scoping too narrowly or too broadly, missing critical assets or threats.
- Focusing only on technical threats and ignoring business process vulnerabilities.
- Treating the threat model as a one-time deliverable rather than a living document.
- Prioritizing based on intuition rather than risk evaluation.
- Failing to engage cross-functional stakeholders for validation.

## Best Practices for Effective Threat Modeling

- Integrate threat modeling early into the system design process.
- Use visuals like DFDs to make system understanding and threat discovery easier.
- Prioritize high-impact, high-likelihood threats first.
- Document assumptions, tradeoffs, and mitigations clearly.
- Iterate threat models at major project milestones or after significant design changes.
- Teach threat modeling as a shared responsibility among architects, engineers, and product managers.
- Automate threat modeling data collection where possible, but never replace human judgment.

## Threat Modeling Outputs and Deliverables

- Asset inventories and trust boundary diagrams
- Identified threats mapped to system components
- Prioritized risk lists with mitigation plans
- Control implementation matrices
- Threat model update schedules
- Lessons learned and improvement recommendations

## Emerging Topics in Threat Modeling

| Topic | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **Threat Modeling as Code** | Encoding threat models in machine-readable formats for automation and integration into CI/CD pipelines. |
| **AI-Augmented Threat Modeling** | Using artificial intelligence to assist in threat discovery and pattern recognition. |
| **Threat Modeling for Privacy** | Expanding threat models to include privacy harms and regulatory violations. |
| **Cloud-Native Threat Modeling** | Addressing unique risks in containerized, serverless, and multi-cloud environments. |

*Threat modeling is not just about finding vulnerabilities. It is about thinking like an attacker, defending like a strategist, and building systems that anticipate failure with resilience.*
