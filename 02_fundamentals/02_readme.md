# Fundamentals

This section of the "So You Want To Be A Security Architect?" repository establishes the essential building blocks for anyone aspiring to practice security architecture effectively. These topics provide the intellectual foundation for designing resilient systems, thinking like an adversary, and making risk-informed decisions.

Mastering fundamentals is not optional. It is the core capability that allows Security Architects to adapt to evolving threats, emerging technologies, and shifting business landscapes without losing strategic clarity.

## Purpose of This Section

- Introduce foundational security principles that guide good architectural design.
- Develop structured threat modeling skills to anticipate and mitigate risks early.
- Equip architects to apply risk management thinking to technical decisions.

While tools, platforms, and methodologies evolve, these fundamentals remain universal.

## What You Will Learn

| Topic | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| **Security Principles** | Understand key principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, separation of duties, and fail-safe defaults that underlie secure system design. |
| **Threat Modeling** | Learn structured approaches (STRIDE, PASTA, and others) for systematically identifying threats during system and solution design. |
| **Risk Management** | Gain the ability to evaluate risks, prioritize mitigations, and make design decisions aligned with business risk tolerance and strategic goals. |

## Contents

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `security_principles.md` | Introduces essential design principles that strengthen system security posture by default. |
| `threat_modeling.md` | Provides practical threat modeling frameworks, techniques, and starter templates. |
| `risk_management.md` | Explains how risk evaluation and treatment guide architectural tradeoffs and security control design. |

---

## How to Use This Section

- Study the security principles not as static rules, but as lenses to evaluate every system design.
- Practice threat modeling early in the architecture lifecycle, not after systems are built.
- Use risk management frameworks to justify decisions in technical and business contexts.
- Revisit these fundamentals regularly as your designs and threat environments grow more complex.

> "Security architecture is not about memorizing controls. It is about mastering the thinking that makes secure design inevitable."

*The fundamentals are not the beginning. They are the core you carry forward into every design, every review, and every risk decision you will ever make as a Security Architect.*
