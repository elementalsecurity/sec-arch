# Fundamentals

Fundamentals form the intellectual foundation of Security Architecture. Before an architect can design resilient systems, select controls, or evaluate solutions, they must first master the principles, models, and frameworks that govern secure thinking.

This section provides the essential mental models for all Security Architects:
- How to think about system design and adversarial threats
- How to anchor decisions in structured principles, not reactive defenses
- How to align security strategy to risk analysis and business value

Without mastery of these fundamentals, secure architecture becomes guesswork. With them, it becomes a disciplined craft.

## Purpose of This Section

- Teach the principles that make systems defensible by design
- Develop threat modeling skills to anticipate and mitigate adversarial behavior
- Embed risk thinking into security decision-making processes

## What You Will Learn

| Topic | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| **Security Principles** | Understand the foundational laws that guide secure system architecture, such as least privilege, defense in depth, separation of duties, and fail-safe defaults. |
| **Threat Modeling** | Build the ability to identify, analyze, and prioritize threats systematically during design and system evolution. |
| **Risk Management** | Learn how to evaluate risks, prioritize mitigations, and align security decisions with business goals and risk appetites. |

## Contents

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `security_principles.md` | A deep dive into the timeless principles that guide secure system design. |
| `threat_modeling.md` | Structured methods and models to anticipate and neutralize adversarial threats. |
| `risk_management.md` | Strategic frameworks for making informed security tradeoffs based on risk evaluation. |

## How to Use This Section

- Treat security principles as a mental checklist during every design, review, and analysis activity
- Make threat modeling a continuous, living process and not a one-time event
- Apply risk management thinking to every architectural choice, control selection, and exception decision
- Revisit these fundamentals periodically as you encounter more complex systems, evolving threats, and shifting business environments

> "Architecture without principles is fragile. Architecture without threat modeling is blind. Architecture without risk thinking is reckless. Master the fundamentals, and everything you build will stand stronger."

Security Architecture mastery begins here, not in tools or technologies, but in disciplined thinking, principled design, and risk-informed action.
