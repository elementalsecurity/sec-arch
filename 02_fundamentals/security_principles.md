# Security Principles

Security principles are the fundamental laws that guide the design of resilient systems. They form the lens through which Security Architects view architectures, threats, and controls. Principles provide the stable foundation that enables secure decision-making even as technologies, threats, and business environments evolve.

Architects who internalize security principles build systems that are naturally defensible, naturally auditable, and naturally aligned to business risk.

This document provides a deep exploration of the core security principles every Security Architect must master.

## Purpose of Security Principles

- Provide a stable reference framework for design decisions
- Enable consistent risk evaluation and control justification
- Guide tradeoffs when security, usability, and performance collide
- Support alignment between technical security goals and business objectives

## Core Security Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Least Privilege** | Grant only the minimum necessary rights or permissions to users, processes, and systems. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Layer multiple independent security controls to increase overall resilience. |
| **Fail-Safe Defaults** | Default systems and applications to deny access unless explicitly allowed. |
| **Separation of Duties** | Divide critical functions among multiple actors to prevent fraud or error. |
| **Economy of Mechanism** | Keep security designs as simple and small as possible to reduce vulnerabilities. |
| **Complete Mediation** | Check every access to resources for authorization, without relying on caching or assumptions. |
| **Open Design** | Design systems based on publicly known and scrutinized mechanisms, not hidden logic. |
| **Least Common Mechanism** | Minimize shared components to reduce interdependencies and potential breach points. |
| **Psychological Acceptability** | Make security controls usable and non-intrusive to promote adoption and reduce circumvention. |
| **Accountability and Auditing** | Log critical actions and ensure actions can be traced to responsible parties. |

## Applying Security Principles in Architecture

| Scenario | Principle(s) Applied |
|:---------|:--------------------|
| Designing IAM permissions for a SaaS platform | Least Privilege, Separation of Duties |
| Building a secure remote access solution | Defense in Depth, Fail-Safe Defaults |
| Architecting microservices communication | Least Common Mechanism, Complete Mediation |
| Designing incident response logging and alerting | Accountability and Auditing, Open Design |

## Common Pitfalls When Ignoring Principles

- **Overprivileged Access:** Violating least privilege by granting excessive permissions.
- **Flat Networks:** Ignoring defense in depth and segmentation.
- **Excessive Complexity:** Violating economy of mechanism by creating sprawling, difficult-to-defend architectures.
- **Unmonitored Critical Actions:** Weak auditing leading to undetected misuse or breaches.
- **Security Theater:** Controls that create friction without delivering measurable protection.

## Best Practices for Embedding Principles

- Treat principles as design constraints from the earliest system conception stages.
- Require architectural justifications when deviating from principles.
- Review principles at every architecture checkpoint and design review.
- Educate engineering and product teams on the reasoning behind principles, not just the rules.
- Build reference architectures and templates that embody principles by default.
- Continuously revisit principles during system evolution, especially during major changes.

## Emerging Considerations for Modern Architectures

| Context | Adaptation of Principles |
|:--------|:------------------------|
| Cloud-native architectures | Apply least privilege and economy of mechanism to cloud IAM and microservices design. |
| Zero Trust models | Emphasize complete mediation and fail-safe defaults in authentication and authorization. |
| Privacy-enhancing technologies | Strengthen psychological acceptability by designing usable consent and transparency mechanisms. |
| DevSecOps pipelines | Embed accountability and defense in depth across the CI/CD lifecycle. |

*Security principles are not optional guardrails. They are the DNA of secure design. They are the habits of mind that separate accidental architectures from resilient ones.*
