# Fundamentals

This section of the "So You Want To Be A Security Architect?" repository covers the foundational elements every aspiring Security Architect must understand before designing systems or evaluating tools. These topics are the intellectual scaffolding that supports strategic decision-making and risk-aware architecture.

While tools and technologies change frequently, the core principles, threat analysis skills, and risk frameworks discussed here remain constant and universally relevant.

## What You'll Learn in This Section
- The core **Security Principles** that govern secure system design
- How to perform structured **Threat Modeling** using proven methodologies like STRIDE and PASTA
- How **Risk Management** frameworks inform architecture decisions and control prioritization

These fundamentals equip architects with the perspective to align security decisions to both business impact and adversarial thinking.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `security_principles.md` | Introduces foundational principles such as least privilege, defense in depth, and fail-safe defaults |
| `threat_modeling.md` | Explains methodologies for identifying and mitigating threats during system design |
| `risk_management.md` | Describes how to evaluate, prioritize, and treat risks in alignment with architecture decisions |

## How to Use This Section
- Reference the security principles as design heuristics when building or reviewing architecture
- Practice threat modeling early and often in your project lifecycle
- Use risk management to justify security decisions in business terms

> "Great architects donâ€™t just build secure systems, they design with risk, threat, and principle in mind."
