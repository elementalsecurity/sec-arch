# Secure Design Principles

Secure design principles are the practical extensions of foundational security principles into the everyday work of building systems. They provide a structured way to ensure that security is not bolted on at the end but is embedded from the earliest design stages.

Applying secure design principles rigorously enables architects and engineers to create systems that are resilient to attack, auditable, and adaptable to changing threat landscapes.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the secure design principles every Security Architect should apply during system and solution development.

## Purpose of Secure Design Principles

- Embed security protections early in system and software designs
- Create architectures that are inherently defensible rather than reactively protected
- Reduce the cost, complexity, and risk of late-stage security retrofits
- Build systems that are trustworthy by design, not by chance

## Core Secure Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Secure Defaults** | Systems should default to the most secure configuration possible, requiring users to opt in to reduced protections rather than opt out. |
| **Minimal Attack Surface** | Expose only what is necessary. Disable unused services, ports, features, and interfaces to reduce opportunities for exploitation. |
| **Least Privilege** | Grant the minimal level of access or capability required to perform a function, both for users and system components. |
| **Fail Securely** | Systems should fail in a manner that maintains security rather than exposing sensitive data or leaving services unprotected. |
| **Separation of Duties** | Critical operations should require multiple distinct actors to complete, preventing single points of abuse. |
| **Complete Mediation** | Every access request should be validated and authorized, not just the initial one. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple layers of independent security controls should protect critical assets. No single control should be solely relied upon. |
| **Auditable Actions** | Important actions and events should be logged in a tamper-resistant way to support detection, investigation, and compliance. |
| **Psychological Acceptability** | Security mechanisms should not unduly interfere with legitimate user activities. Usability should support, not undermine, security. |
| **Security by Obscurity is Not Enough** | Protect systems through strong design and controls, not by hoping attackers will not find hidden weaknesses.

## Practical Applications in Architecture

| Design Context | Applied Principles |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Cloud IAM Design | Least Privilege, Separation of Duties, Complete Mediation |
| API Gateway Configuration | Minimal Attack Surface, Secure Defaults, Auditable Actions |
| Application Session Management | Fail Securely, Defense in Depth, Psychological Acceptability |
| Microservices Architecture | Minimal Attack Surface, Defense in Depth, Complete Mediation |
| Incident Response Logging | Auditable Actions, Fail Securely |

## Best Practices for Secure System Design

- Start every system design review with a secure design principles checklist.
- Treat violations of these principles as architectural risks that must be explicitly justified.
- Engage threat modeling early to validate that principles are being applied correctly.
- Require developers and system engineers to align technical specifications with secure design goals.
- Document design decisions that trade off security for usability, performance, or cost, and evaluate risks carefully.
- Perform security design reviews at major project milestones, not just before deployment.

## Common Pitfalls When Secure Design Principles Are Ignored

- Systems are deployed with insecure default settings (e.g., open ports, default credentials).
- Flat networks allow unrestricted lateral movement between systems.
- Authentication bypasses occur because only initial requests are validated.
- Sensitive failures leak debugging information to attackers.
- Logging is insufficient to reconstruct attacks or detect anomalies.
- Security mechanisms are so complex that users find ways to bypass them.

*Secure design principles are not about making systems more complicated. They are about making systems stronger, simpler, and safer from the very first line drawn on the architecture whiteboard.*
