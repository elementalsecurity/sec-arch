# Identity Federation for Mergers & Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) require integrating two or more identity systems rapidly and securely to enable collaboration, preserve business continuity, and reduce cyber risk. A poorly executed identity merger can lead to breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance failures.

This reference model provides a structured approach to federating identities during M&A events while maintaining Zero Trust principles.

## Problem Statement

During M&A activities, companies must enable users from different organizations to access systems, collaborate, and share resources **before** full directory consolidation can occur. Traditional directory merges are slow and risky.

**Identity Federation solves:**
- Time-to-collaboration delays
- Credential synchronization risks
- Trust boundary visibility
- Compliance and auditability gaps during integration

---

## Core Components

- **Identity Providers (IdPs):** Retain source IdPs initially (Azure AD, Okta, Ping, etc.).
- **Federation Layer:** Establish SAML 2.0 / OIDC trust relationships between IdPs.
- **Access Proxy / Conditional Access Policies:** Enforce posture-based and identity-based access control on shared resources.
- **Cross-Directory Group Mapping:** Map or synchronize roles, group memberships, and entitlements logically without immediate consolidation.
- **Monitoring and Audit Layer:** Centralized logging of cross-org authentication and access events.
- **Risk Engine (optional):** Apply adaptive access policies based on entity risk scores.

---

## Assumptions

- Both organizations have an existing IdP that supports modern federation protocols (SAML 2.0, OIDC).
- Neither side is immediately ready for full directory consolidation.
- Data classification and resource protection levels are known and mapped.
- Trust agreements (legal and operational) are established for authentication sharing.

---

## Logical Diagram Description

- **User Authentication:**
  - User authenticates to their home IdP.
  - Home IdP issues assertion/token to access federated resources.
- **Access Request:**
  - Access proxy or relying party validates the assertion against federation trust policies.
  - Conditional access enforces device compliance, risk scoring, and MFA as needed.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - All cross-domain authentications are logged centrally for forensic readiness.

## Adaptations & Constraints

| Consideration | Adaptation |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| Asymmetric Directory Maturity | Use federation from mature IdP to emerging IdP with tighter access restrictions. |
| Short-Term Collaboration Only | Use ephemeral access solutions like External Identities (Azure AD B2B) or temporary trust. |
| Long-Term Integration | Plan progressive consolidation after successful federation, minimizing downtime. |

## Related Frameworks and Standards

- **NIST SP 800-63 (Digital Identity Guidelines)**
- **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture - Identity Pillar)**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (Annex A.9 - Access Control)**
- **PCI DSS 4.0.1 (Requirement 7 and 8: Access Control and Authentication)**

---

## Key Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Impact |
|:---------|:-------|
| Federation vs. Full Directory Merge | Faster enablement, but longer-term complexity if federation lingers indefinitely. |
| Assertion Trust Window | Longer session lifetimes ease UX but increase risk exposure if credentials are compromised. |
| User Attribute Mapping | Differences in schema and roles can lead to misaligned access if not carefully mapped. |

## Real-World Example (Generalized)

**Regional Bank Acquisition:**
- Bank A (Azure AD) acquires Bank B (Okta).
- Established SAML federation within 30 days to allow loan officers, branch employees, and auditors to access shared apps.
- Conditional access enforced device compliance and MFA across both orgs.
- Full directory consolidation completed 9 months later after operational and risk alignment.
