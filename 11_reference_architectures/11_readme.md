# Reference Architectures

This section provides foundational reference architectures that aspiring and practicing Security Architects can use to design secure, scalable, and resilient systems.

Reference architectures are not blueprints to copy blindly. They are **structured starting points** â€” examples of how to think about security at system and organizational levels.

Each model includes:
- A description of the architecture
- Core components and design patterns
- Assumptions and constraints
- Practical diagrams (where applicable)
- Guidance on when and how to adapt it for real-world use



## Initial Available Models

- **Zero Trust Enterprise Architecture**
  Secure identity-first access across enterprise systems and users.

- **Secure Cloud Landing Zone**
  Baseline security controls for public cloud environments.

- **Identity Federation for Mergers & Acquisitions**
  Patterns for integrating separate IAM systems securely.

- **PCI DSS Payment Data Flow**
  Architecting data flows that meet PCI DSS 4.0 requirements.

- **Secure DevOps Pipeline**
  Embedding security in modern CI/CD workflows without killing speed.

- **Privacy by Design Architecture for GDPR Compliance**
  Building systems that respect user privacy from the ground up.



## How to Use These Models

- **As a starting point:** Adapt patterns based on your organization's risk profile, regulatory environment, and technology stack.
- **For reviews and approvals:** Support design reviews with clear baseline models.
- **For communication:** Help business and technology leaders visualize secure system patterns.

Architecture is about structured thinking, not rigid compliance. Use these models as tools for clarity, adaptability, and impact.



*Security Architecture is the art of shaping complexity into trusted systems.*
