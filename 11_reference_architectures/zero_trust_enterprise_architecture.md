# Zero Trust Enterprise Architecture

Zero Trust is a strategic approach to cybersecurity that replaces implicit trust with continuous verification across users, devices, applications, and networks. It is not a single technology, but a system-wide design philosophy that assumes breach and designs defenses accordingly.

This reference model provides a reusable, modular architecture pattern for applying Zero Trust principles to enterprise environments.

## Problem Statement

Traditional perimeter-based security models assume that entities inside the network are trustworthy. This approach breaks down in modern, hybrid, cloud-centric environments where users, devices, and workloads operate across distributed systems.

**Zero Trust solves:**
- Insider threat risk
- Credential theft and lateral movement
- Device drift and unmanaged access
- Remote and hybrid workforce challenges

---

## Core Components

- **Identity Provider (IdP):** Central source for user authentication and federated identity (SSO, MFA enforcement).
- **Access Proxy / Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** Gateways that enforce access policies between users/devices and resources.
- **Policy Decision Point (PDP):** Service that evaluates real-time trust decisions based on identity, device posture, location, behavior.
- **Device Posture Service:** Validates device compliance (e.g., MDM enrollment, OS patching, security tools).
- **Resource Gateways:** Application-layer and data-layer gateways that control access to internal services, APIs, databases.
- **Logging and Monitoring Platform:** Central collection of access events, behavior analytics, and incident detection.
- **Risk Engine:** (optional) Adaptive risk scoring service that dynamically adjusts access conditions based on risk posture.

---

## Assumptions

- All users and devices must authenticate and be authorized before accessing any resource.
- Device posture can be measured at the time of access.
- Network location alone does not grant access.
- Security controls must be applied as close to the resource as possible (micro-segmentation).
- Centralized logging and event correlation are available for monitoring and response.

## Logical Diagram Description

- **User or Device Initiates Request** → **Identity Provider Verifies Identity** → **Policy Engine Evaluates Context** → **Access Proxy Enforces Decision** → **Resource Access Granted or Denied**
- Each connection re-evaluates trust, considering device health, user role, location, and behavior.
- No direct network layer access to sensitive resources without crossing authentication and policy checks.

## Adaptations & Constraints

| Consideration | Adaptation |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| Legacy Applications | Use access proxies or app-wrapping solutions to mediate access without native Zero Trust support. |
| BYOD Policies | Implement risk scoring and conditional access policies for unmanaged devices. |
| Global Workforce | Deploy regionally distributed access proxies and align to latency-sensitive application needs. |
| Regulatory Constraints (PCI, HIPAA) | Map policy enforcement to specific compliance controls and audit log requirements. |

---

## Related Frameworks and Standards

- **NIST SP 800-207:** Zero Trust Architecture
- **CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect)**
- **PCI DSS 4.0.1 (Access Control, Monitoring, Authentication)**

---

## Key Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Impact |
|:---------|:-------|
| Increased authentication steps | Can introduce friction if not balanced with user experience (SSO, adaptive MFA). |
| Performance overhead | Additional proxy layers may add latency, requires careful placement and scaling. |
| Complexity in legacy environments | Retrofitting Zero Trust in non-cloud-native systems requires incremental steps. |
| Monitoring demands | Requires mature SIEM/SOAR integration to track and respond to dynamic access patterns. |

## Real-World Example (Generalized)

**Global Retail Company:**
- Implemented Zero Trust network segmentation across stores, warehouses, and corporate offices.
- Required all POS devices to validate device posture and user authentication before accessing inventory or payment systems.
- Reduced lateral movement risk, minimized breach impact, and improved audit outcomes for PCI DSS compliance.

*Zero Trust is not a product. It is a mindset to build every access decision as if no network is trusted, and every user, device, and application must prove its legitimacy, every time.*
