# Secure Cloud Landing Zone

A Secure Cloud Landing Zone is a pre-configured, governed, and monitored cloud environment designed to provide a safe foundation for deploying workloads. It standardizes identity, networking, monitoring, and security controls from the first deployment forward.

This reference model provides a reusable baseline for building secure, compliant public cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).

---

## Problem Statement

Without a consistent cloud foundation, organizations risk:
- Inconsistent identity and access management
- Lack of network segmentation and over-permissive security groups
- Missing audit trails and monitoring gaps
- Misaligned resource tagging and ownership
- Regulatory compliance failures (PCI, HIPAA, GDPR)

Secure Landing Zones solve these problems by establishing security, operational, and governance controls **before** cloud adoption scales.

---

## Core Components

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Centralized authentication, role-based access control, MFA enforcement, service principals.
- **Network Architecture:** Segmented VPCs/VNets, private subnets, restricted ingress/egress points, transit gateways.
- **Baseline Security Controls:** Default encryption at rest and in transit, managed key services (KMS, Key Vault).
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Centralized logging to immutable storage, security event collection (e.g., GuardDuty, Security Command Center).
- **Guardrails and Policies:** SCPs (AWS), Azure Policies, Organization Policies (GCP) to enforce security standards.
- **Resource Tagging Framework:** Standardized tags for ownership, environment, data classification, and compliance requirements.
- **Account/Subscription/VPC Factory:** Automated creation of new environments with built-in controls.

---

## Assumptions

- All cloud accounts/subscriptions must onboard through a governed process.
- Workloads inherit baseline security controls by default.
- Centralized monitoring and log ingestion is mandatory.
- Encryption and least privilege are enforced automatically.
- Manual exceptions are formally reviewed and documented.

## Logical Diagram Description

- **Landing Zone Management Plane**
  - Identity Provider (SSO Integration)
  - Organization/Management Account
  - Policy Management Engine (e.g., AWS Control Tower, Azure Blueprint)
- **Networking Layer**
  - Centralized hub VPC/VNet
  - Segmented application VPCs/VNets (spokes)
  - Shared services VPC (e.g., AD, DNS, logging)
- **Security and Monitoring Layer**
  - Centralized log buckets and SIEM integration
  - Threat detection tooling integration (native and third-party)
- **Provisioning Layer**
  - Infrastructure as Code pipelines (Terraform, ARM, Deployment Manager)

## Adaptations & Constraints

| Consideration | Adaptation |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| Multi-cloud Strategy | Deploy Landing Zones in parallel across providers, harmonizing policy enforcement and identity. |
| Highly Regulated Environments | Customize encryption, key management, audit log retention, and segmentation based on regulatory frameworks. |
| Small Startups or PoC Projects | Apply lightweight Landing Zone with progressive hardening as workloads mature. |

## Related Frameworks and Standards

- **CIS Cloud Benchmarks (AWS, Azure, GCP)**
- **NIST 800-53 (AC, AU, SC, SI families)**
- **ISO 27001:2013 Annex A Controls**
- **PCI DSS 4.0.1 (Cloud Hosting Security Requirements)**
- **CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)**

## Key Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Impact |
|:---------|:-------|
| Increased initial setup complexity | Requires investment in IaC, policy frameworks, and operational maturity. |
| Potential innovation friction | Teams must operate within guardrails, balancing security with autonomy. |
| Resource cost overhead | Centralized logging, monitoring, and encryption incur additional cloud costs. |

## Real-World Example (Generalized)

**Global SaaS Company:**
- Deployed secure Landing Zones across AWS and Azure to support rapid multi-region expansion.
- Automated account/VPC creation through pipelines with pre-approved guardrails.
- Reduced misconfiguration incidents by 75%.
- Achieved continuous compliance readiness for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications.

*A Secure Cloud Landing Zone is not just a technical construct. It is an agreement — a contract — that security, visibility, and operational readiness are embedded from the very first workload.*
