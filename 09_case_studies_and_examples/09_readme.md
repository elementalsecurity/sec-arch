# Case Studies and Examples

This section of the _"So You Want To Be A Security Architect?" repository is designed to ground theory in practice. Each case study offers a narrative-driven, technically detailed walkthrough of a real-world architecture challenge, highlighting how security design decisions are made under constraints, trade-offs, and evolving business needs.

These examples help aspiring and current Security Architects understand what "good" looks like when applied to complex, high-stakes environments.

## What You'll Find Here
Each case study is structured to highlight:
- **Context and Business Problem**
- **Architecture Requirements**
- **Constraints and Risks**
- **Security Design Decisions**
- **Control Framework Mapping**
- **Architecture Diagrams (Markdown-compatible)**
- **Outcomes and Lessons Learned**

These aren't sanitized textbook exercises. They're practical, nuanced, and drawn from field-tested scenarios that involve:
- Cloud migration projects
- Identity consolidation after M&A
- Designing Zero Trust for retail
- PCI DSS compliance for custom e-commerce
- Secure DevOps in regulated environments
- Scalable detection and response architectures

---

## Who This Is For
- Architects seeking tactical reference patterns
- Engineers moving into design leadership roles
- Analysts and GRC professionals wanting context for security controls
- Interviewees preparing to answer “walk me through an architecture you’ve designed”

## Case Study Directory

| Case Study | Focus Area |
|------------|-------------|
| `secure-cloud-migration.md` | Azure migration with full-stack security integration |
| `zero-trust-retail.md` | Zero Trust implementation for global retail environments |
| `identity-federation-for-merger.md` | Post-merger identity unification using Entra ID and SAML federation |
| `detection-pipeline-architecture.md` | Security data ingestion, SIEM design, MITRE-aligned detection use cases |
| `pci-dss-for-custom-ecommerce.md` | Scoping and securing a homegrown checkout platform for PCI DSS 4.0 |
| `secure-devops-in-a-regulated-pipeline.md` | Embedding security gates and IaC scanning into HIPAA-bound CI/CD workflows |

---

## How to Use These
- Use them as **blueprints** for internal projects
- Adapt the security control language to your frameworks (NIST, ISO, PCI)
- Reference them during interviews or internal design reviews
- Build out variations of these as your own portfolio pieces

## Summary
Security Architecture is defined by what you build under pressure. This section shows how strong architecture is not just about selecting controls, it's about how you apply them to serve both security and business outcomes. The best Security Architects think in systems, communicate in stories, and document with clarity.
