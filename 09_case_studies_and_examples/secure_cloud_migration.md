# Case Study: Secure Cloud Migration to Microsoft Azure

## Context and Business Problem
A mid-sized financial services company sought to modernize its infrastructure by migrating key workloads from its on-premises data center to Microsoft Azure. The primary goals were to improve scalability, reduce hardware costs, and modernize operations. However, the organization operated in a regulated environment subject to SOX and GLBA requirements, and leadership had specific concerns around data protection, identity management, and detection capabilities.

The business needed a secure-by-design cloud environment without delaying the migration timeline.

## Architecture Requirements
- Design and deploy a secure Azure landing zone
- Enforce least privilege access and centralized identity
- Secure data in transit and at rest
- Enable real-time threat detection and automated response
- Maintain logging, monitoring, and audit trails for compliance
- Support hybrid connectivity and phased workload migration

---

## Constraints and Risks
- Legacy workloads requiring hybrid connectivity and domain integration
- Limited cloud security expertise among existing IT staff
- Third-party service providers requiring access to cloud workloads
- High sensitivity data subject to encryption and access control
- Regulatory compliance obligations (SOX, GLBA)

---

## Security Strategy

### Landing Zone Foundation
- Used Azure Landing Zone Accelerator to deploy a secure foundation
- Implemented Management Groups, Policy Assignments, and RBAC at the subscription level
- Configured hub-and-spoke network topology with Azure Firewall and NSGs

### Identity and Access Management
- Integrated Entra ID with hybrid AD using Azure AD Connect
- Enforced Conditional Access Policies, MFA, and device compliance checks
- Deployed Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for JIT access to administrative roles

### Data Protection
- All storage accounts configured with Microsoft-managed encryption and customer-managed key support (CMK) via Key Vault
- Sensitive workloads encrypted at application layer using .NET-based envelope encryption pattern
- Azure SQL Database with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and auditing enabled

### Network Security
- Hub-and-spoke model with forced tunneling to on-prem via Azure VPN Gateway
- Segmented workloads using NSGs, ASGs, and Application Gateway WAF
- Denied internet egress except for approved service tags and endpoints

### Detection and Response
- Deployed Microsoft Defender for Cloud with enhanced CSPM and threat detection
- Forwarded logs to Azure Monitor and integrated with Microsoft Sentinel
- Built custom KQL queries and analytics rules aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Integrated Sentinel with ServiceNow for incident ticketing and Cortex XSOAR for playbook execution

### Compliance and Audit
- Enabled Azure Policy to enforce tagging, encryption, and resource location controls
- Continuous compliance dashboards against CIS and NIST policy packs
- Azure Blueprint used to pre-deploy resource groups with audit policy inheritance

## Control Framework Mapping

| Control Category | Implementation |
|------------------|----------------|
| IAM | Entra ID, PIM, RBAC, Conditional Access |
| Data Protection | TDE, CMK, Key Vault, DLP controls |
| Network Security | NSGs, Azure Firewall, VPN Gateway |
| Detection | Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, custom KQL |
| Logging | Azure Monitor, Activity Logs, Diagnostic Settings |
| Governance | Azure Policy, Blueprint, Management Groups |

## Outcome and Lessons Learned

- Migration completed in four phases over 7 months with zero security incidents
- Visibility across hybrid infrastructure improved significantly with centralized logging
- Conditional Access policies prevented unauthorized third-party login attempts
- Key risks mitigated through layered defense: encryption, network control, and identity hardening
- Staff were upskilled in Azure security through parallel enablement training

### Lessons Learned
- Start with identity. Cloud security depends on centralized, policy-enforced access.
- Policy-as-code is critical. Azure Policy and Blueprint helped ensure repeatable governance.
- Hybrid complexity must be managed. Forced tunneling and legacy DNS introduced early latency issues that required tuning.
- Detection must be use-case aligned. Generic alerts create noise; custom rules aligned with MITRE ATT&CK produced better signal.

---

## Summary
This case study highlights how a secure cloud migration can be achieved through a layered architecture approach, with identity, policy, and detection tightly integrated into every stage. It shows how a defensible design framework enables compliance, scalability, and real-world security outcomes even under regulatory and operational pressure.
