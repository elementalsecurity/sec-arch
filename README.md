# So You Want to Be a Security Architect?  
### A Field Manual for Building and Breaking Secure Systems

Welcome.  
This repository is a **public, vendor-neutral knowledge base** that teaches security architecture from first principles all the way to runnable, cloud-native reference implementations.  
Clone it, fork it, rip it apart, improve it—just keep the 🔍 rigor and 🧭 clarity.

## 1  Why This Repo Exists  — Mission

> **Raise the bar** for security design across the industry by sharing battle-tested patterns, end-to-end reference architectures, and hands-on labs—**free and forever**.

We prioritise:

* **First-principles reasoning** over cargo-cult “best practices”  
* **Concrete artifacts** (diagrams ⇢ IaC ⇢ tests) over slideware  
* **Open governance**—every control or pattern is open to scrutiny and debate

## 2  Who Should Use This

| You are… | This repo gives you… |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Practicing architect** | Reference diagrams, trade-off logs, compliance overlays |
| **Cloud engineer / DevOps** | IaC blueprints (Bicep, CDK, GCP blueprints) you can deploy today |
| **GRC / compliance pro** | Mappings from technical controls to PCI DSS 4.0, NIS 2, GDPR |
| **Student / career-changer** | A structured learning path, labs, and first-principles drills |

## 3  Architect’s Core Mindset (Memorise These)

| Focus | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Systems Thinking** | Controls interact—design the whole, not point fixes. |
| **Risk Orientation** | Architecture exists to manage *business* risk, not chase “perfect” security. |
| **Adversary Empathy** | Model how a real attacker crosses each trust boundary. |
| **Engineering Pragmatism** | Patterns must be deployable by real teams, under real deadlines. |
| **Continuous Learning** | Stacks change quarterly; mental models outlive products. |

## 4  Foundational Domains to Master

* Identity & Access Management (OIDC, FIDO2, least-privilege, escalation paths)  
* Network & Segmentation (Zero Trust, service mesh, private connectivity)  
* Application Security (threat modelling, API security, SBOM, supply-chain)  
* Data Protection (classification, encryption, tokenisation, key lifecycle)  
* Infrastructure & Cloud (landing zones, CSPM, container hardening)  
* Logging & Response (OCSF schemas, detection pipelines, purple-team feedback)  
* Governance, Risk & Compliance (NIST CSF 2.0, PCI 4.0, NIS 2, GDPR)

## 5  First-Principles Thinking (30-second Version)

1. **Define the irreducibles** — the asset properties that must never break.  
2. **Decompose the system** — minimal data-flow diagram; locate implicit trust.  
3. **Identify natural forces** — adversary capabilities, entropy, human error.  
4. **Quantify risk** — even rough math beats hand-waving.  
5. **Derive control objectives** before naming products.  
6. **Select mechanisms last**—ensure they can fail safe *and* be tested.  
7. **Validate with counter-examples**—prove each invariant really holds.

## 9  Contributing

1. **Fork** → feature branch → **PR**.  
2. Sign commits (`git commit -s`).  
3. Pass Markdown lint & docs build workflows.  
4. For new patterns or controls: include a threat description, design rationale, and tests/lint for any IaC.
