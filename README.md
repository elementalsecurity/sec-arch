# So You Want To Be a Security Architect?

_A practical, structured, and strategic guide to mastering security architecture, system design, and risk-aligned thinking._

This repository is a comprehensive enablement guide for anyone looking to become a professional Security Architect, elevate their thinking, or structure a security architecture program across technology, process, and business domains.

It combines foundational knowledge, industry frameworks, technical playbooks, design decision guides, architecture challenges, and strategic mental models, organized across progressive tracks.

Whether you are a beginner, a mid-level engineer transitioning to architecture, or a senior leader mentoring others, this repo provides a practical, opinionated path to mastery.

## Philosophy

Security Architecture is not just about frameworks, tools, or technologies.
It is about:
- Seeing systems clearly
- Making tradeoffs visible
- Designing for trust under constraints
- Aligning business and security goals
- Documenting decisions others can build upon

This is a living body of work. You are invited to explore, adapt, and contribute.
