# So You Want To Be a Security Architect?

This repository is a comprehensive enablement guide for anyone looking to become a professional Security Architect, elevate their thinking, or structure a security architecture program across technology, process, and business domains.

It blends foundational knowledge, industry frameworks, technical playbooks, design decision guides, architecture challenges, and strategic mental models, all organized across progressive tracks.

Whether you're a beginner, a mid-level engineer transitioning to architecture, or a senior leader mentoring others, this repo provides a practical, opinionated path to mastery.

## Philosophy

Security Architecture is not just about tools and frameworks.
Itâ€™s about:
- Seeing systems clearly
- Making tradeoffs visible
- Designing for trust under constraints
- Aligning business and security goals
- Documenting decisions others can build on

This is a living body of work, and you are invited to explore, adapt, and contribute.
