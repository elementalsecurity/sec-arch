# So You Want to Be a Security Architect?
### A Field Manual for Building - and - Breaking - Secure Systems

Welcome. This repository is a public, vendor-neutral knowledge base that teaches security architecture from first principles through cloud-native reference implementations. Clone it, fork it, and adapt it while maintaining rigorous clarity.

## Why This Repo Exists - Mission

Raise the bar for security design by sharing battle-tested patterns, end-to-end reference architectures, and hands-on labs - free and forever.

## Who Should Use This

| You are...                 | This repo gives you...                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Practicing security architect | Reference diagrams, trade-off logs, compliance mappings                |
| Cloud engineer / DevOps      | Deployable IaC blueprints (Bicep, CDK, GCP Blueprints)                |
| GRC / compliance professional | Controls mapped to PCI DSS, NIS 2, GDPR, ISO 27001                     |
| Learner / career-changer     | Structured learning paths, labs, and first-principles exercises        |

## Architectâ€™s Core Mindset

- Systems thinking - design the whole system, not point fixes  
- Risk orientation - manage business risk, not chase perfect security  
- Adversary empathy - model real attackers crossing trust boundaries  
- Engineering pragmatism - ensure patterns are deployable under real constraints  
- Continuous learning - mental models outlast any single product  

## Documentation Structure
