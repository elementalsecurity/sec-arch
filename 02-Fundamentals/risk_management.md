# Risk Management

Risk Management in Security Architecture involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats that could impact an organization's information systems, data, or operations. It forms the backbone of strategic decision-making in cybersecurity and helps prioritize security efforts based on business impact.

## Core Components of Risk Management

### 1. Risk Identification
Catalog all potential risks to organizational assets. Sources of risk may include:
- Cyber threats (malware, phishing, APTs)
- Insider threats
- System or process failures
- Regulatory non-compliance

### 2. Risk Assessment
Evaluate risks by determining:
- **Likelihood**: How probable is the occurrence?
- **Impact**: What would be the consequence if it occurred?

Use qualitative (e.g., high/medium/low) or quantitative (e.g., monetary value, probability metrics) methods for analysis.

### 3. Risk Prioritization
Rank risks to determine which should be addressed first, typically using a risk matrix or heatmap.

### 4. Risk Treatment
Select one or more of the following actions:
- **Accept**: Tolerate the risk when impact is minimal or mitigation is not cost-effective.
- **Mitigate**: Apply controls to reduce the likelihood or impact.
- **Transfer**: Shift risk through insurance or outsourcing.
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the activity or asset causing the risk.

### 5. Monitoring and Review
Continuously monitor risk posture and reassess as technology, threats, and business environments evolve.

## Frameworks and Standards Supporting Risk Management
- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**
- **ISO/IEC 27005**
- **COSO Enterprise Risk Management**

## Role in Security Architecture
Risk management ensures that architecture decisions are aligned with the organization's risk tolerance and strategic objectives. It supports:
- Justification of security investments
- Prioritization of architectural initiatives
- Communication of risk to stakeholders

By integrating risk management into the security architecture lifecycle, organizations can proactively address threats while maintaining agility and operational effectiveness.
