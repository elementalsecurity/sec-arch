# Security Principles

Security Principles are foundational guidelines that inform the development and implementation of effective security measures within any organization. These principles serve as universal best practices, ensuring a robust, coherent, and comprehensive approach to security architecture.

## Fundamental Security Principles

### Least Privilege
Ensure individuals and systems are granted the minimum level of access—or permissions—required to perform their duties effectively, reducing the potential for unauthorized access or damage.

### Defense in Depth
Employ multiple layers of security controls throughout an information system to provide redundancy and reduce the risk of a single point of failure.

### Fail-Safe Defaults
Design systems to deny access by default, ensuring explicit permission is necessary for access, thereby minimizing unauthorized entry points.

### Open Design
The security of a system should not rely on secrecy of its design or implementation. Security should be robust even when adversaries know the system's design.

### Separation of Duties
Distribute critical tasks and responsibilities among multiple individuals or teams to reduce the risk of fraud, error, or sabotage.

### Complete Mediation
Every access request must be validated and authorized each time, without relying on cached permissions, ensuring continuous security validation.

### Economy of Mechanism
Keep the security design simple and streamlined, as simplicity decreases the likelihood of vulnerabilities and makes it easier to secure, monitor, and maintain.

### Psychological Acceptability
Ensure that security mechanisms are user-friendly and do not unduly hinder legitimate operations, increasing compliance and effectiveness.

## Importance of Security Principles

Adhering to these principles helps organizations build a secure environment resilient against diverse threats and adaptable to technological advancements. These principles guide architects in decision-making processes, ensuring security measures are effective, efficient, and practical.
