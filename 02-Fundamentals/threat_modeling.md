# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a structured approach used by Security Architects and professionals to identify, evaluate, and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities within a system or application. This proactive practice helps ensure that security risks are understood and mitigated during the design phase, rather than addressing them reactively after deployment.

## Key Components of Threat Modeling

### 1. Asset Identification
Identify and classify assets (data, infrastructure, applications) based on their value and importance to the organization.

### 2. Threat Identification
Enumerate potential threats by examining how assets could be targeted by attackers or compromised through vulnerabilities.

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment
Identify weaknesses or gaps in security controls that could be exploited by threats.

### 4. Risk Analysis
Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified threats exploiting vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on severity and impact.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies
Develop and implement strategies to reduce or eliminate risks, such as applying security controls, redesigning components, or improving operational processes.

### 6. Documentation and Communication
Clearly document threat modeling activities, findings, and mitigation strategies, and communicate them effectively to stakeholders.

## Popular Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE
- **Spoofing**: Identity impersonation threats.
- **Tampering**: Unauthorized alteration of data or systems.
- **Repudiation**: Denial of actions performed.
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Interrupting service availability.
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining higher access levels illicitly.

### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
A seven-step, risk-centric methodology combining threat analysis and attack simulation for deeper insights.

### Trike
A risk-based approach with a focus on requirements, risk tolerance, and threat modeling automation.

## Importance of Threat Modeling

Threat modeling enables organizations to proactively identify and address security issues, significantly reducing security risks. By systematically evaluating threats early in the lifecycle, organizations can design more secure, resilient systems and respond effectively to evolving cybersecurity threats.
