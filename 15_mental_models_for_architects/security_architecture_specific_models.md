# Security Architecture Specific Models

This document introduces mental models specifically tuned for Security Architects. These models focus on secure system design, risk analysis, and resilience thinking.

Applying these models helps architects reason more effectively about threats, trust boundaries, defenses, and systemic risk management.

## 1. Trust Boundary Mapping

**Definition:**
Trust Boundary Mapping involves identifying points in a system where different levels of trust meet, and where security controls must be concentrated.

**How Architects Use It:**
- Recognize where authentication, authorization, and validation are essential.
- Focus design effort where external, internal, partner, or user systems interface.
- Avoid assuming implicit trust inside system components.

**Key Questions:**
- Where does external input enter the system?
- Where do different administrative domains connect?
- Where is trust assumed without verification?

**Example:**
Treating internal API calls with the same scrutiny as external ones because they cross service boundaries.

## 2. Attack Surface Reasoning

**Definition:**
Attack Surface Reasoning focuses on identifying and minimizing the number of ways an adversary could interact with or influence a system.

**How Architects Use It:**
- Design systems with minimal unnecessary exposure.
- Prioritize hardening of externally accessible components.
- Reduce complexity, which often correlates with vulnerability.

**Key Questions:**
- What are all the ways data or commands can enter or exit the system?
- Which paths are necessary, and which can be eliminated or controlled?
- How easily can an attacker discover or exploit these paths?

**Example:**
Reducing exposed management interfaces to a single hardened bastion rather than leaving multiple services accessible directly over the internet.

## 3. Defense-in-Depth Layering

**Definition:**
Defense-in-Depth Layering uses multiple, independent security controls across different system layers to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.

**How Architects Use It:**
- Design redundancy into security controls.
- Assume that any single control may fail and plan compensating measures.
- Slow down attackers, increase detection opportunities, and provide resilience.

**Key Questions:**
- If this control fails, what backup protections exist?
- Are controls diverse, or do they share a single point of failure?
- Are detection and response measures layered along with prevention?

**Example:**
Enforcing strong endpoint security controls, network segmentation, and centralized logging so that if malware bypasses one layer, it is detected or contained at another.

## 4. Minimum Viable Security (MVS)

**Definition:**
Minimum Viable Security is the smallest set of security measures that can reasonably protect a system at launch, enabling speed while managing risk.

**How Architects Use It:**
- Enable early delivery without sacrificing critical security principles.
- Prioritize controls that provide maximum risk reduction for minimum effort.
- Plan for security growth in post-launch phases.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the minimum security baseline that must be in place before launch?
- What higher maturity controls can be added iteratively?

**Example:**
Requiring authentication, encryption, and logging for MVP cloud applications even if full threat modeling or red teaming is deferred to later stages.

## 5. Resilience over Prevention

**Definition:**
Focus not only on preventing all attacks but also on designing systems that detect, contain, and recover from attacks quickly when they inevitably occur.

**How Architects Use It:**
- Prioritize monitoring, detection, and response planning.
- Design for rapid containment and restoration.
- Accept that breaches are possible and manage consequences proactively.

**Key Questions:**
- If this system is compromised, how quickly can it be detected?
- How can we contain the blast radius?
- How can we recover operations safely and securely?

**Example:**
Designing cloud environments with workload isolation, automated incident response playbooks, and immutable infrastructure redeployment strategies.

*Security Architecture is not about eliminating all threats. It is about shaping the system so that threats are harder to exploit, easier to detect, and less damaging when they do.*
