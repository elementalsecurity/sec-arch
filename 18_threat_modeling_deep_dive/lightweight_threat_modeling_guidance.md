# Lightweight Threat Modeling Guidance

Threat modeling does not need to be a heavy, resource-intensive process to be effective. In fast-moving environments, applying lightweight, scalable threat modeling techniques allows teams to surface critical risks early without slowing delivery.

This document provides practical strategies for integrating threat modeling into real-world projects efficiently and sustainably.

## Core Goals of Lightweight Threat Modeling

- **Consistency:** Perform security thinking on every project, even if briefly.
- **Focus:** Prioritize identifying the most critical threats and risks.
- **Scalability:** Make threat modeling accessible to all teams, not just security experts.
- **Adaptability:** Fit the process into agile, DevOps, and continuous delivery workflows.

Lightweight threat modeling is about asking the right questions at the right time — not producing exhaustive, heavyweight documentation.

## Lightweight Threat Modeling Workflow

### 1. Establish a System Overview

- Create a simple diagram showing major components, data flows, trust boundaries, and external integrations.
- No need for exhaustive technical detail; focus on critical paths and exposures.

### 2. Identify High-Value Assets and Trust Boundaries

- Highlight sensitive data, privileged systems, or critical business functions.
- Mark where data crosses between different trust levels (e.g., public users into internal services).

### 3. Apply a Simple Threat Checklist

Ask basic but powerful questions:
- What can go wrong with authentication, authorization, and session management?
- How could an attacker tamper with data or communications?
- What sensitive data could be exposed if controls fail?
- How could service availability be disrupted?
- Where could an attacker gain elevated privileges or persist?

(Optional: Map to STRIDE categories if helpful.)

### 4. Prioritize Threats

- Focus on high-impact and high-likelihood risks first.
- Consider business context, regulatory implications, and system criticality.

### 5. Define Key Mitigations

- Identify security controls, design changes, or monitoring mechanisms that reduce risk.
- Capture decisions informally in project documentation, tickets, or architecture diagrams.

### 6. Embed in Iterations

- Revisit and refine the threat model as designs evolve or major features are added.
- Make it part of design reviews, sprint planning, or release checklists.

## Tips for Effective Lightweight Threat Modeling

- Keep diagrams simple and focused on major flows and exposures.
- Encourage collaborative sessions with architects, developers, product owners, and security.
- Timebox sessions (e.g., 30–60 minutes) to stay focused and reduce analysis paralysis.
- Use templates and checklists to standardize and accelerate the process.
- Treat threat models as living artifacts that evolve alongside the system.

## Lightweight Threat Modeling Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| Waiting until after development is complete | Misses design-level risks that are expensive to fix later. |
| Turning every session into a full risk management audit | Overwhelms teams and discourages participation. |
| Focusing only on technical vulnerabilities | Misses business logic, operational, and insider threats. |
| Treating the first model as final | Threat landscapes change; models must evolve too. |

*Threat modeling at scale is not about finding every possible threat. It is about systematically improving your system’s survivability, one thoughtful design decision at a time.*
