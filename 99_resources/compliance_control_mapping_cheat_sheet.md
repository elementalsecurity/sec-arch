# Compliance Control Mapping Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a high-level reference for aligning control objectives across major cybersecurity frameworks. It is not a one-to-one mapping, but rather a comparative lens to help Security Architects and GRC professionals rationalize overlapping controls and streamline multi-framework compliance strategies.

## Tips for Multi-Framework Alignment
1. **NIST CSF** is a lifecycle-based framework. It provides excellent structure for risk communication and role mapping.
2. **ISO/IEC 27001** is control-governed and strong for enterprise-wide governance.
3. **PCI DSS 4.0.1** is highly prescriptive and technical, great for scoping enforcement.
4. **SOC 2** is principle-driven, making it ideal for SaaS maturity proof.
5. **CIS Controls** are actionable and prioritized, ideal for tactical engineering alignment.

---

## Common Mapping Strategies
- Use NIST CSF as a **master structure** and map ISO/SOC 2/PCI controls beneath its functions.
- Use PCI DSS as a **technical control anchor** for environments with cardholder data.
- Use ISO for **global operations and auditability** across multiple regions.
- Use CIS Controls as **project-level implementation guides**.

## Summary
Security programs often operate under multiple regulatory and assurance frameworks. This cheat sheet helps you harmonize them efficiently, prioritize implementation, and avoid duplication of effort. Use it during architectural reviews, gap assessments, or policy rationalization efforts.

> "Controls are different expressions of the same core goal: reduce risk and preserve trust. Translate wisely."
