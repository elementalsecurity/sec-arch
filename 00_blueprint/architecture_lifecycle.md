# Security Architecture Lifecycle

This lifecycle model provides a high-level view of where Security Architecture fits into the broader context of system development and operations.

It helps clarify *when* to engage as a security architect, *what* to focus on at each phase, and *how* your architectural thinking ensures the continuity and resilience of secure systems.

This lifecycle pairs closely with the [Skill Progression Map](skill_progression.md) to show how strategic thinking and architectural engagement evolve over time.

Both models reinforce that Security Architecture is not just a role, it's a rhythm — a continuous practice of aligning, designing, adapting, and improving.
