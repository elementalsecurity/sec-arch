# Section 00 â€“ Blueprint: Becoming a Security Architect

Welcome to the starting point.

This section is designed for anyone beginning their journey into Security Architecture, whether you are shifting careers, building technical depth, or looking to understand the mindset that drives real-world security design.

Security Architecture is not about memorizing frameworks or deploying tools. It is about learning how to think, how to design for trust, and how to balance protection with possibility.

In this section, you will find:

- **Becoming a Security Architect: The Blueprint**  
  A practical guide that connects the skills, stages, and strategic thinking needed to grow into a Security Architect role.

The goal here is simple: give you a clear mental model before you dive deeper into the technical, strategic, and operational topics throughout the rest of this repository.

Take your time here. The better you understand the blueprint, the stronger every piece that follows will be.
