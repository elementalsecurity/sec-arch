# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architectural decisions shape the long-term security, resilience, and scalability of systems. Yet too often, the reasoning behind these critical decisions is lost over time.

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** provide a lightweight, structured way to capture key decisions, document tradeoffs, and support transparency and continuous improvement.

This track introduces ADRs, explains their importance, and provides practical guidance for creating and maintaining them effectively.

## Purpose of This Track

- Define what Architecture Decision Records are and why they matter.
- Provide a simple, repeatable format for writing ADRs.
- Offer real-world examples relevant to security architecture.
- Share best practices for using ADRs to support governance, design reviews, and operational resilience.

## Why Architecture Decision Records Matter

- **Preserve Organizational Memory:** Documenting why decisions were made prevents knowledge loss over time.
- **Improve Transparency:** Clearly articulate tradeoffs, alternatives considered, and risk acceptance.
- **Support Audits and Reviews:** Provide traceable evidence of security and architectural due diligence.
- **Accelerate Onboarding:** Help new team members understand system rationale faster.
- **Enable Informed Evolution:** Future changes can build on, adapt, or deliberately revisit past decisions with full context.

ADRs are not heavyweight governance artifacts. They are practical, living records that make security and architecture thinking visible and actionable.

*Architecture decisions are not just technical choices. They are trust choices, risk choices, and resilience choices. Capturing them well strengthens everything that follows.*
