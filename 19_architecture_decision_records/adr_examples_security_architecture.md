# ADR Examples for Security Architecture

Security architecture decisions often involve complex tradeoffs between usability, scalability, compliance, and threat mitigation.

This document provides real-world examples of how to capture security-relevant decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each example follows the standard ADR structure defined earlier.

## Example 1: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Internal Applications

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
- Multiple internal applications manage sensitive employee and customer data.
- Lack of consistent access control across applications increases audit risk.
- Regulatory frameworks (e.g., SOX, GDPR) require demonstrable access control governance.

### Decision
- Adopt Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as the primary access control model for all internal applications.
- Standardize role definitions across applications where possible.
- Integrate RBAC enforcement with the central identity provider (IdP).

### Alternatives Considered
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) (Rejected: too complex for current application maturity and team skillsets).
- Decentralized, application-specific access control (Rejected: inconsistent enforcement and audit challenges).

### Consequences
- Improves access governance and auditability.
- Requires role engineering and periodic reviews to avoid role explosion.
- Simplifies user provisioning and deprovisioning processes.

## Example 2: Require Mutual TLS (mTLS) Between Microservices

**Status:** Proposed

### Context
- Microservices communicate within Kubernetes clusters over internal networks.
- Service-to-service traffic currently lacks authentication and encryption.
- Internal threats and misconfigurations could enable lateral movement without mTLS.

### Decision
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication and encryption between all microservices.
- Leverage the service mesh's native certificate management and enforcement capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered
- Plaintext internal traffic (Rejected: does not align with Zero Trust principles).
- IP-based firewall rules only (Rejected: insufficient for identity assurance and encryption needs).

### Consequences
- Increases security of east-west traffic.
- Adds slight CPU overhead for encryption operations.
- Requires certificate rotation monitoring and service mesh maintenance.

## Example 3: Centralize Secrets Management with Cloud-Native Vault

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
- Secrets (API keys, database credentials, certificates) are inconsistently managed across teams.
- Static secrets in environment variables and code repositories increase exposure risk.
- Cloud provider offers a native secrets management service with strong integration options.

### Decision
- Adopt the cloud-native secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) as the standard for all applications and services.
- Require applications to retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime rather than embedding them.

### Alternatives Considered
- Deploy self-managed open-source secrets vault (Rejected: increased operational burden without strong justification).
- Continue ad hoc secrets management (Rejected: high security and compliance risks).

### Consequences
- Reduces likelihood of secret leakage.
- Requires changes to application startup logic and secure retrieval patterns.
- Introduces minimal additional costs for secret storage and API usage.

## Usage Note

These examples illustrate how ADRs can:
- Capture security assumptions and tradeoffs transparently.
- Create an audit trail for major security architecture decisions.
- Enable future teams to understand the "why" behind current system behavior and constraints.
