# ADR Best Practices

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are most valuable when they are consistent, clear, and maintainable over time.

This document provides practical best practices for writing, managing, and governing ADRs within security architecture and broader technical environments.

## Writing High-Quality ADRs

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|:---------|:---------------|
| **Focus on Significant Decisions** | Capture decisions that materially affect system behavior, security posture, operational complexity, or organizational risk. |
| **Be Concise but Complete** | Clearly state the decision, context, alternatives, and consequences without unnecessary verbosity. |
| **Capture Reasoning, Not Just Outcomes** | Explain "why" a decision was made, not just "what" was decided. Tradeoffs are often more important than the final choice. |
| **Use Clear, Unambiguous Language** | Avoid jargon and internal shorthand that may confuse future readers. |
| **Time-Stamp and Version ADRs** | Record when the decision was made to provide historical context. If superseded, link forward to the new ADR. |

## Organizing and Managing ADRs

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|:---------|:---------------|
| **Sequential Numbering** | Assign each ADR a unique sequential ID (e.g., ADR-001, ADR-002) for easy reference and traceability. |
| **Directory Structure** | Store ADRs in a clearly labeled directory (e.g., `/docs/adr/`) within repositories or documentation hubs. |
| **Simple, Predictable File Names** | Use formats like `adr-001-title.md` to enable easy searching and sorting. |
| **Status Management** | Update ADRs as they are Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded. Maintain status fields visibly. |
| **Link Related ADRs** | When one decision influences or builds on another, link them explicitly to preserve decision chains. |

## Governance and Review Best Practices

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|:---------|:---------------|
| **Integrate ADR Reviews into Architecture Processes** | Review ADRs during design reviews, governance boards, or major milestone checkpoints. |
| **Avoid Retrospective Fabrication** | Create ADRs when decisions are made, not retroactively to "justify" decisions after the fact. |
| **Allow Decisions to Evolve Transparently** | When decisions change, write new ADRs rather than rewriting history. Capture learning and evolution.
| **Encourage Cross-Disciplinary Contributions** | Security, development, operations, risk, and compliance teams should all contribute to ADR discussions when relevant. |
| **Treat ADRs as Living Documents** | Revisit major decisions periodically, especially after major incidents, technology shifts, or organizational changes. |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Impact |
|:--------|:-------|
| Capturing trivial decisions | Dilutes the value of ADRs and increases maintenance burden. |
| Writing ADRs only for approvals or audits | Leads to shallow, incomplete reasoning and reduces real-world usefulness. |
| Omitting rejected alternatives | Hides critical tradeoffs that future teams may need to understand. |
| Letting ADRs drift out of sync | Breaks trust in documentation and forces teams to rely on oral history. |

*Good ADRs are not documentation bureaucracy. They are investments in organizational clarity, resilience, and technical wisdom.*
