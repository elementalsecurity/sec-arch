# Section 04 â€“ Frameworks and Standards

This section of the _"So You Want To Be A Security Architect?"_ repository provides detailed, practical insights into the most widely used **security frameworks**, **compliance mandates**, and **industry standards** that inform and guide architectural design decisions.

Security Architects must understand how these frameworks interact, how they shape risk-based decision-making, and how to translate their requirements into actionable technical and governance controls.

---

## What You'll Learn in This Section
- Core security frameworks like **NIST CSF**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, and **CIS Controls**
- Regulatory standards such as **PCI DSS 4.0.1**, **HIPAA**, **SOX**, **SOC 2**, and **GDPR**
- Threat-centric models including **MITRE ATT&CK**, **OWASP**, and structured **threat modeling methodologies**
- Comparative analyses (e.g., **SOC 2 vs ISO 27001**, **CCPA/CPRA vs GDPR**, **SAQ vs ROC**)
- Strategic architecture references for **Zero Trust** and **Secure DevOps** design

This section is vital for aligning security architecture with real-world compliance obligations, risk frameworks, and detection strategies.

## How to Use This Section
- Use the individual framework documents as reference points when aligning your architecture to compliance obligations
- Refer to the threat modeling and detection methodology documents when building or reviewing detection strategies
- Leverage comparative and strategic design documents to make informed decisions during design reviews or executive presentations

> "Security Architecture is only as strong as the frameworks that inform it. Mastering them is the foundation of confident, compliant design."
