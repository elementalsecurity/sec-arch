# Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

The **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)** (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) is a landmark EU regulation designed to strengthen the IT security and operational resilience of financial entities and their critical third-party service providers. DORA establishes a unified, cross-sector approach to managing ICT risks in the financial sector.

## Purpose of DORA

- Ensure financial entities can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats
- Harmonize ICT risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing, and third-party oversight across the EU financial sector
- Foster a secure and stable financial ecosystem that is resilient to cyber and operational threats

## Scope of Applicability

DORA applies to a wide range of regulated entities, including:
- Banks, investment firms, payment and e-money institutions
- Insurance and reinsurance companies
- Crypto-asset service providers (under MiCA)
- Trading platforms, central securities depositories, CCPs
- Credit rating agencies and crowdfunding providers
- ICT third-party service providers (e.g., cloud, data analytics, software)

## Core Requirements of DORA

### 1. **ICT Risk Management (Chapter II)**
- Establish a risk management framework with governance, accountability, and reporting lines
- Maintain an updated inventory of ICT assets and dependencies
- Conduct business impact analysis (BIA) and risk assessments
- Implement policies for patching, secure development, and asset configuration

### 2. **ICT Incident Reporting (Chapter III)**
- Classify ICT-related incidents and significant cyber threats
- Notify competent authorities within defined timelines:
  - Initial notification: within 4 hours of classification
  - Intermediate report: within 72 hours
  - Final report: within 1 month
- Maintain internal logs and post-mortem analysis

### 3. **Digital Operational Resilience Testing (Chapter IV)**
- Conduct advanced penetration testing (Threat-Led Penetration Testing or TLPT) every 3 years
- Validate capabilities to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents
- Cover critical systems, business functions, and third-party integrations

### 4. **ICT Third-Party Risk (Chapter V)**
- Establish a register of third-party ICT providers
- Conduct due diligence, risk assessments, and exit strategies
- Use contractual clauses covering availability, integrity, access, and audits
- Critical ICT service providers may be directly supervised by Lead Overseers appointed by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)

### 5. **Information Sharing (Chapter VI)**
- Participate in trusted threat intelligence sharing communities (voluntary)
- Ensure compliance with data protection and confidentiality obligations

## Enforcement and Supervision

- DORA becomes fully enforceable on **January 17, 2025**
- National competent authorities (e.g., central banks, financial supervisors) will oversee compliance
- Critical ICT providers may face **direct supervision** under ESA oversight (e.g., EBA, ESMA, EIOPA)
- Non-compliance can lead to administrative sanctions, supervisory measures, and reputational damage

## Interplay with Other Frameworks

DORA aligns with and complements:
- **NIS2 Directive** (cyber resilience)
- **GDPR** (data protection)
- **EBA Guidelines** (ICT and security risk management)
- **ISO/IEC 27001**, **NIST 800-53**, and **TIBER-EU** (resilience testing)

## Role of Security Architects

Security Architects must:
- Integrate operational resilience into enterprise architecture planning
- Design for availability, redundancy, and recovery in critical financial systems
- Support risk-based classification of ICT incidents
- Implement secure-by-design controls in development and third-party onboarding
- Architect detection and alerting mechanisms that align with DORA’s reporting timelines
- Collaborate on third-party risk frameworks with procurement and legal teams

## Strategic Impact

DORA sets a new benchmark for cyber resilience in finance. It mandates a proactive, risk-informed, and testable approach to ICT security. Architects must enable systemic resilience—not just for compliance, but for operational continuity and trust in an increasingly digitized financial sector.
