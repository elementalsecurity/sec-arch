# SOC 2 vs. ISO/IEC 27001: Comparison and Mapping Guide

Security-conscious organizations often choose between or implement both **SOC 2** and **ISO/IEC 27001** to demonstrate strong information security practices. While both frameworks offer assurance, they serve different audiences, operate under different models, and require unique implementations.

---

## Overview of Each Framework

| Feature | SOC 2 | ISO/IEC 27001 |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Developed By | AICPA (U.S.) | ISO/IEC (International) |
| Primary Focus | Internal controls over security and trust services | Comprehensive ISMS (Information Security Management System) |
| Applicability | SaaS and service organizations (esp. U.S.-based) | Any organization, any size, globally |
| Certification | Attestation report by CPA firm | Formal ISO certification by accredited body |
| Report Types | Type I (point in time), Type II (over time) | Certification valid for 3 years, with annual surveillance |
| Public Disclosure | Private report to customers | Certificate can be public; statement of applicability shared selectively |

---

## Similarities

- Risk-based and control-oriented
- Require documentation of security policies and procedures
- Emphasize access control, incident response, and change management
- Involve internal audit, management review, and continuous improvement
- Align with NIST CSF and other governance models

## Key Differences

| Area | SOC 2 | ISO/IEC 27001 |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Audit Scope | System-specific (defined services and controls) | Organization-wide ISMS (with defined scope boundaries) |
| Audit Authority | CPA firm | ISO-accredited certification body |
| Control Framework | AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC) | ISO/IEC 27002 control set via Annex A |
| Customization | Controls mapped to service commitments | Controls selected based on risk assessment and applicability |
| Frequency | Annual audit window (Type II) | 3-year cycle with surveillance audits |
| Level of Detail | Narrative and testing of controls | Clause-based conformity assessment + control validation |

## Mapping the Frameworks

| ISO/IEC 27001 Clause/Annex A | SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A.5 Information Security Policies | CC1.2: Management and governance of security policies |
| A.6 Organization of Information Security | CC1.3: Organizational roles and responsibilities |
| A.7 Human Resource Security | CC1.4, CC5.3: Employee onboarding and awareness |
| A.8 Asset Management | CC5.1: Identification and classification of assets |
| A.9 Access Control | CC6.1–6.7: Logical access, privilege management, MFA |
| A.10 Cryptography | CC6.6: Encryption of sensitive data |
| A.11 Physical Security | CC6.2: Physical and environmental controls |
| A.12 Operations Security | CC6.7, CC7.1: Monitoring and change management |
| A.13 Communications Security | CC6.8, CC6.9: Network protection and monitoring |
| A.14 System Acquisition and Development | CC5.2, CC6.1: Secure SDLC and testing |
| A.15 Supplier Relationships | CC7.2: Vendor risk management |
| A.16 Incident Management | CC7.4: Incident response planning and review |
| A.17 Business Continuity | CC7.3: Backup, DR, and resilience planning |
| A.18 Compliance | CC8.x: Legal, regulatory, and contractual compliance |

## Strategic Decision Criteria

| Consideration | Choose SOC 2 if... | Choose ISO/IEC 27001 if... |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Target Market | You sell to U.S.-based enterprises | You sell globally or into regulated verticals |
| Buyer Expectations | Buyers request a Type II audit | Buyers prefer ISO certification badge |
| Organizational Maturity | You are scaling security practices | You want formalized enterprise security management |
| Product Architecture | You provide a SaaS product or service | You want ISMS across multiple business units |

---

## Combined Implementation Strategy

Organizations often pursue **both SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001** to:
- Meet diverse customer requirements
- Increase trust and competitive differentiation
- Use ISO 27001 as a baseline and tailor SOC 2 for product-specific validation

Approach:
1. Build your ISMS under ISO 27001
2. Select Trust Services Criteria aligned with ISO controls
3. Reuse evidence and control design across both audits
4. Synchronize audit timelines for efficiency

---

## Summary

SOC 2 and ISO 27001 are **complementary**, not competing frameworks. By understanding their structure, audiences, and expectations, Security Architects can architect compliance programs that scale across markets and industries—meeting stakeholder trust demands while building robust and testable security infrastructure.
