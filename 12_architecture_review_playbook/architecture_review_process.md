# Architecture Review Process

A structured architecture review process ensures that security is embedded into system designs early, that risks are identified and managed before deployment, and that the organization can make informed decisions about risk acceptance, mitigation, or avoidance.

This document outlines a standard, repeatable process for conducting Security Architecture Reviews.

---

## Step 1: Intake and Scoping

- Receive an Architecture Review Request via the Architecture Review Intake Form.
- Validate the scope of the review:
  - New system, significant change, decommissioning, integration, migration, etc.
- Categorize the review:
  - Full Review (high risk or complex systems)
  - Light Review (small changes or low-risk systems)
- Confirm stakeholders:
  - Project owners, engineering leads, compliance representatives, risk owners.

---

## Step 2: Pre-Review Preparation

- Review intake materials:
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Threat models (if available)
  - Compliance requirements
- Request additional documentation if needed:
  - Control frameworks
  - Integration plans
  - Dependency mappings
- Set preliminary review agenda:
  - Key focus areas based on system type and risk profile.

---

## Step 3: Conduct the Review Session

- Facilitate a structured review meeting with stakeholders.
- Walk through system design, data flows, and control mappings.
- Use the Architecture Review Checklist as a guide.
- Capture identified risks, gaps, and questions live during the session.
- Document agreed-upon action items and next steps.

---

## Step 4: Risk Assessment and Recommendations

- Classify identified risks:
  - Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Provide recommendations:
  - Design changes
  - Compensating controls
  - Monitoring enhancements
  - Residual risk acceptance considerations
- Align risk ratings with organizational risk management frameworks.

---

## Step 5: Architecture Review Report

- Create a formal Architecture Review Report summarizing:
  - Scope and context
  - Diagrams reviewed
  - Key findings and recommendations
  - Residual risks and ownership assignments
- Submit the report to the project team and risk management as required.
- Archive the report in the architecture governance repository.

---

## Step 6: Follow-up and Closure

- Track remediation action items.
- Validate completion of high-priority fixes if applicable.
- Update residual risk acceptance records.
- Officially close the review.

---

## Key Principles

- Focus reviews on risk reduction, not perfection.
- Tailor depth of review to the risk and complexity of the system.
- Keep reviews structured, time-bound, and actionable.
- Maintain a record of reviews for audit, compliance, and governance transparency.
- Collaborate with project teams to build secure designs, not create adversarial dynamics.
