# Architecture Review Report Template

This template provides a standardized structure for documenting the results of a Security Architecture Review.

The report captures the system design context, key findings, risk assessments, recommendations, and risk ownership decisions. It serves as a record of security engagement in technical initiatives and supports future audits, compliance needs, and continuous improvement.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

| Area | Finding | Risk Level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) | Recommendation |
|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------------------------|:---------------|
| Identity and Access | Example: No MFA on admin accounts | High | Enforce MFA for all privileged access |
| Data Protection | Example: Sensitive data stored unencrypted | Critical | Encrypt data at rest using approved KMS |
| Network Security | Example: Flat network, no segmentation | High | Implement VLAN segmentation and firewalls |
| Application Security | Example: Missing input validation on APIs | Medium | Add server-side input validation checks |
| Cloud Security | Example: Unrestricted S3 bucket access | Critical | Apply least privilege access policies |
| Threat Detection | Example: No centralized log collection | Medium | Forward critical logs to SIEM with integrity controls |
