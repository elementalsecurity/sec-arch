# Architecture Review Playbook

Security architecture reviews are a critical checkpoint in the system development and change management lifecycle. A well-run review identifies risks early, aligns security requirements to business objectives, and ensures that secure design principles are embedded before systems are deployed or changed.

This section provides a structured approach to conducting Security Architecture Reviews that are thorough, collaborative, and focused on enabling secure outcomes without becoming barriers to delivery.



## Purpose of Architecture Reviews

- Validate that proposed systems and changes meet security, compliance, and risk management requirements.
- Identify design flaws, gaps, or unnecessary complexity that could introduce vulnerabilities.
- Provide practical, risk-based recommendations for secure implementation.
- Align technical decisions with organizational strategy, policy, and regulatory obligations.
- Create defensible documentation of security engagement in major initiatives.

Architecture Reviews are not about finding perfection. They are about finding, communicating, and mitigating risk in a way that supports business objectives.

## How to Use This Playbook

- **For Security Architects:** Lead reviews consistently and credibly. Focus on enabling secure designs, not obstructing delivery.
- **For Project Teams:** Understand expectations early and collaborate to design with security in mind.
- **For Risk Management and Compliance:** Capture evidence of security engagement in technical decision-making processes.

Architecture Reviews should build bridges, not walls. A good review improves system quality, reduces future rework, and builds trust between security and delivery teams.



*The goal of an architecture review is not to control decisions. It is to bring risk into focus, so the organization can make better-informed choices.*
