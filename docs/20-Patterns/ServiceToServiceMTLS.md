# Service-to-Service mTLS Pattern

**Summary**  
Authenticate and encrypt all service-to-service communication using mutual TLS to ensure both endpoints are verified.

## Problem and Context
- Unauthenticated internal traffic can be intercepted or tampered with.
- Single TLS (server-only) does not verify client services.
- Microservice architectures require strong service identity.

## Threat Considerations
- MITM attacks on internal traffic.
- Spoofing of service endpoints.
- Certificate compromise or mismanagement.

## Solution Description
1. Issue service certificates signed by a private CA.
2. Enable mutual TLS on all service endpoints.
3. Services validate peer certificate against CA and required SAN.
4. Rotate certificates automatically and revoke compromised ones.

## Implementation Notes
- Use automated CA (e.g., Istio CA, HashiCorp Vault).
- Integrate certificate rotation into CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor for expired or revoked certificates.

## Real-World Example
- Service mesh deployments like Linkerd and Istio rely on this pattern to secure in-cluster traffic.
