# AWS Landing Zone with AWS CDK

**Summary**  
Use AWS CDK in TypeScript to provision a multi-account landing zone with organizational units, SCPs, networking, and guardrails.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Node.js and AWS CDK installed
- AWS Identity Center or AWS IAM for user management
- Existing AWS Organization

## Steps
1. **Initialize CDK Project**  
   ```bash
   cdk init app --language typescript
   ```
2. **Define Organizational Structure**  
   - Create OU constructs for security, workloads, and shared services.
   - Attach Service Control Policies.
3. **Networking Stack**  
   - Define VPC with multiple AZs, subnets (public, private, isolated).  
   - Enable flow logs and routing.
4. **Security and Guardrails**  
   - CDK constructs for AWS Config rules, CloudTrail trails, and CloudWatch alarms.  
   - Automate IAM role and key management.
5. **Shared Services**  
   - Deploy centralized logging, SIEM integration, and audit trail bucket.
6. **Pipeline Deployment**  
   - Use CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to synthesize and deploy CDK stacks.

## Example Snippet
```typescript
const vpc = new Vpc(this, 'LandingZoneVPC', {
  cidr: '10.100.0.0/16',
  maxAzs: 3,
  subnetConfiguration: [
    { name: 'Public', subnetType: SubnetType.PUBLIC },
    { name: 'Private', subnetType: SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS },
  ],
});
```
