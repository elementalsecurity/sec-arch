# Zero Trust Reference Architecture - Overview

## 1. Context & Scope
- Business drivers: cloud adoption, perimeter erosion, regulatory mandates
- In-scope workloads: VMs, containers, serverless functions, SaaS integrations
- Out-of-scope: legacy on-prem applications, operational technology networks

## 2. Objectives & Design Principles
- Never implicitly trust any network segment or identity
- Enforce least-privilege end-to-end
- Ensure strong telemetry for detection and auditing
- Automate policy-as-code for drift prevention

## 3. High-Level Components
- Identity broker (authentication and authorization)
- Policy enforcement points (API gateway, service mesh proxies)
- Data protection plane (key management system, envelope encryption)
- Telemetry and detection ingestion pipeline

## 4. Threat Model Summary
- Primary adversaries: insider threat, supply-chain compromise, credential theft
- Key attack vectors and mitigations

## 5. Diagram Guide
Refer to the Diagram.mmd file for a visual representation of trust boundaries, control zones, and data flows.
