# Security Policy

Thank you for helping improve the quality and security of this repository. We welcome all responsible disclosures, secure development feedback, and vulnerability reports.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability in this repository or any associated files, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue or pull request.**
2. Instead, email the maintainer directly at: **info@elementalsec.com**
3. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce, if applicable
   - Any suggested remediation or guidance

We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and work to verify and resolve the issue.

If the issue affects a broader ecosystem or external dependency (e.g., GitHub Pages, open-source tool), we will coordinate with those teams as appropriate.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you:
- Allow us a reasonable time to resolve before publicly disclosing
- Avoid scanning or automated probing that could be disruptive
- Only test against systems you control and do not target live users

We will credit valid reports (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) in our project changelogs and readme if the fix is public.

## Hardening Scope
This repository is intended for public consumption and education, but we maintain the following practices:

- No secrets, credentials, or production environment configurations are stored here
- Templates and sample data are hardened to the extent possible
- All contributions are reviewed before merge into protected branches

## Contact
For non-sensitive security questions, feel free to open an issue labeled `security-question`.

For disclosures or time-sensitive risks, contact: **info@elementalsec.com**

Thank you for supporting responsible open-source security.
