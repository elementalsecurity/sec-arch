# MITRE Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework

The **MITRE Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework** is a strategic approach to designing and implementing systems that can **anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to** cyber threats. It is particularly valuable for mission-critical and high-assurance environments where security breaches and disruptions are likely.

Rather than focusing purely on prevention, MITRE emphasizes engineering for **resilience**, ensuring continued operation even in contested or degraded conditions.

---

## Purpose of the Framework

- Design systems that remain trustworthy under advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Enable **mission assurance** in adversarial environments
- Promote proactive defense by embedding resilience into the system lifecycle
- Extend traditional cybersecurity with **anticipation, recovery, and adaptation** capabilities

---

## Core Resiliency Goals

The framework defines **four strategic goals**:

1. **Anticipate** – Recognize and prepare for potential cyber threats or disruptions
2. **Withstand** – Resist or absorb the impact of an attack without significant degradation
3. **Recover** – Restore mission-critical services and functions quickly
4. **Adapt** – Learn from experience and improve security posture over time

## Eight Cyber Resiliency Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Analytic Monitoring** | Real-time monitoring and situational awareness |
| **Coordinated Protection** | Integration of controls across system components |
| **Deception** | Misdirection and camouflage to increase adversary cost |
| **Diversity** | Use of heterogeneous components to prevent single points of failure |
| **Dynamic Positioning** | Moving target defense and reconfiguration |
| **Non-Persistence** | Removing unused components to reduce attack surface |
| **Privilege Restriction** | Least privilege, separation of duties |
| **Redundancy** | Alternate paths, components, or processes for recovery |

These techniques can be tailored to specific mission or system needs.

---

## Mapping to System Lifecycle

The Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework aligns with the **NIST Secure System Development Lifecycle (SSDL)** and engineering standards like **NIST SP 800-160**. It supports:

- **Concept exploration**: Mission resilience requirement definition
- **System design**: Selection of architectural patterns for resilience
- **Implementation**: Embedding techniques like deception and redundancy
- **Operations and sustainment**: Monitoring, adaptation, and resilience metrics

---

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

| Framework | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **NIST CSF** | Reinforces Detect, Respond, and Recover functions |
| **ISO 27001** | Expands security into mission assurance and system design |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Provides adaptive response within trust boundaries |
| **TOGAF / SABSA** | Can be mapped to architectural layers and risk profiles |

---

## Security Architecture Implications

Security Architects should:
- Incorporate cyber resiliency goals into reference architectures
- Evaluate trade-offs between system complexity and adaptability
- Use threat modeling to identify resilience gaps
- Design for graceful degradation and failover
- Ensure telemetry, reconfiguration, and response mechanisms are built in

---

## Tooling and Methodologies

- **MITRE ATT&CK + D3FEND**: Map attacker tactics to defensive techniques
- **Simulation and red teaming**: Assess effectiveness under real-world stressors
- **Resilience modeling tools**: Evaluate system behavior under degraded states

---

## Summary

The **MITRE Cyber Resiliency Engineering Framework** shifts cybersecurity from reactive defense to **mission-centric resilience**. It empowers Security Architects and Systems Engineers to anticipate compromise, engineer recovery, and adapt over time and critical in modern systems where **perimeter defenses alone are no longer sufficient**.
