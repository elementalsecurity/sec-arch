# FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework)

The **Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF)** is the official enterprise architecture framework used by the **U.S. Federal Government**. Developed by the **U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB)**, FEAF provides a structured approach for aligning business objectives with IT investments and improving interagency collaboration.

---

## Purpose of FEAF

- Standardize enterprise architecture across federal agencies
- Guide IT governance and investment decisions
- Improve efficiency, interoperability, and citizen service delivery
- Enable consistent reporting and cross-agency integration

---

## FEAF Structure

FEAF is built around **six Reference Models**:

### 1. **Performance Reference Model (PRM)**
Links agency strategic goals to performance outcomes.
- Mission outcomes
- Customer results
- Internal process efficiency

### 2. **Business Reference Model (BRM)**
Defines federal business operations and capabilities across:
- Mission services (e.g., law enforcement, healthcare)
- Support services (e.g., HR, finance, IT)

### 3. **Data Reference Model (DRM)**
Provides standards for data sharing and interoperability:
- Common data vocabularies
- Metadata tagging
- Semantic data integration

### 4. **Application Reference Model (ARM)**
Categorizes software and systems that support business functions:
- Application types
- Interoperability standards
- System lifecycle alignment

### 5. **Infrastructure Reference Model (IRM)**
Defines network, cloud, and computing infrastructure:
- Hosting models
- Middleware services
- Technical standards

### 6. **Security Reference Model (SRM)**
Aligns cybersecurity principles across architecture domains:
- Identity and access management
- Data confidentiality and integrity
- Security controls mapping (e.g., NIST SP 800-53)

## FEAF and Common Approach to Federal EA

In 2012, the **Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture** standardized the use of FEAF across agencies. It emphasizes:
- **Segment Architecture**: Modular approach to EA by mission area or service domain
- **Shared Services**: Promote reuse of government-wide solutions
- **Governance and Reporting**: Enhance transparency through EA maturity assessments

## FEAF vs. Other EA Frameworks

| Feature | FEAF | TOGAF | Zachman | DODAF |
|--------|------|-------|---------|--------|
| Focus | Federal civilian agencies | Businessâ€“IT alignment | Classification taxonomy | Defense systems |
| Reference Models | Yes | No (uses ADM) | No | Structured views |
| Mandated Use | For U.S. agencies | No | No | For DoD entities |
| Security Alignment | High (via SRM + NIST) | Indirect | Indirect | Moderate |

---

## Security Architect Considerations

Security Architects can leverage FEAF to:
- Map security objectives across all six reference models
- Ensure alignment with **NIST RMF**, **OMB A-130**, and **FISMA**
- Define controls in the SRM and trace through business and IT layers
- Support **enterprise-wide risk posture** through standardized architecture

## Tooling and Implementation

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **ArchiMate with FEAF overlays** | Visual modeling of reference models |
| **Sparx EA, BizzDesign, Mega** | Government EA platforms |
| **OMB EA Assessment Toolkits** | Governance and maturity tracking |

---

## Summary

**FEAF** is the cornerstone of federal enterprise architecture in the U.S., providing a mature, reference-model-driven approach to designing interoperable, efficient, and secure government systems. For Security Architects, it offers a robust framework for aligning cybersecurity with mission outcomes and enterprise IT capabilities across civilian agencies.
