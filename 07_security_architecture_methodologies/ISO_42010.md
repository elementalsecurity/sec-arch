# ISO/IEC 42010: Architecture Description Standard

**ISO/IEC 42010** is an international standard for describing software and systems architectures. It does not prescribe a specific framework or methodology, but instead provides a formal approach for documenting and managing architectures through **viewpoints**, **views**, and **stakeholder concerns**.

This standard is widely used to complement other architectural frameworks such as TOGAF, DODAF, and RM-ODP by enabling consistent, well-structured architecture descriptions.

---

## Purpose of ISO/IEC 42010

- Ensure architectural descriptions are **complete, consistent, and understandable**
- Promote effective communication among stakeholders
- Facilitate **reusability and traceability** of architectural decisions
- Support **multi-viewpoint modeling** across complex systems

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Architecture Description (AD)**
An organized collection of **views** that address the concerns of stakeholders and describe the architecture of a system.

### 2. **Stakeholders**
Individuals or groups who have interests in or concerns about the system (e.g., users, developers, operators, regulators).

### 3. **Concerns**
Specific issues relevant to stakeholders (e.g., security, performance, cost, compliance).

### 4. **Viewpoints**
Specifications defining:
- The stakeholders and concerns addressed
- The modeling conventions and techniques used
- How the views will be developed

### 5. **Views**
Actual representations of the system using a selected **viewpoint**. Each view may include diagrams, models, narratives, and tabular information.

## Example Viewpoints

| Viewpoint | Focus | Concern |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Functional Viewpoint | Functions, services | Business operations |
| Information Viewpoint | Data models | Data flow and consistency |
| Deployment Viewpoint | Physical hosting and environment | Resilience, performance |
| Security Viewpoint | Threat modeling, access control | Confidentiality, integrity, compliance |

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

ISO/IEC 42010 is **agnostic** and intended to be used with existing architectural frameworks:

| Framework | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **TOGAF** | Maps to ADM outputs and ArchiMate viewpoints |
| **DODAF** | Each DODAF view corresponds to an ISO 42010 view |
| **RM-ODP** | Formalized using ISO 42010's meta-structure |
| **UML/SysML** | Can be used to build views using standard modeling notations |

---

## Relevance to Security Architecture

Security Architects use ISO/IEC 42010 to:
- Create **security viewpoints** tailored to stakeholder concerns
- Ensure traceability from **business-level risks** to **technical controls**
- Document architecture decisions and rationale
- Structure assurance arguments and compliance mappings
- Improve communication between security, compliance, operations, and design teams

---

## Tool Support

| Tool | Support |
|------|---------|
| **Sparx EA** | Supports multi-view architecture and UML-based modeling |
| **Modelio** | Open-source, customizable viewpoints |
| **ArchiMate/TOGAF Tools** | Provide overlays for ISO 42010 alignment |

---

## Summary

**ISO/IEC 42010** is a foundational standard for **communicating and managing architecture artifacts** across stakeholders and disciplines. It enables flexibility in toolsets and modeling approaches while ensuring a rigorous structure for architecture descriptions. For Security Architects, it supports modular, reusable, and stakeholder-aligned design practices that scale across enterprise and systems-of-systems environments.
