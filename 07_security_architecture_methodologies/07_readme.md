# Security Architecture Methodologies

Security architecture is built on structure. It is not enough to understand technical controls. A Security Architect must also be able to apply **proven, structured methodologies** to analyze, design, document, and govern complex systems.

This section provides a set of critical frameworks and standards that Security Architects rely on. Each represents a different dimension of architecture, from business alignment to technical resilience, from distributed system modeling to formal enterprise planning.

These methodologies do not compete. They complement each other, and skilled architects often blend them to meet real-world challenges.

## Included Methodologies

| Framework | Focus Area |
|:----------|:-----------|
| **ISO/IEC 42010** | Architecture description standard with viewpoints and stakeholder concerns |
| **MITRE Cyber Resiliency Framework** | Engineering resilient systems that can withstand and adapt to cyber threats |
| **NIST SP 800-160** | Systems security engineering integrated throughout the system lifecycle |
| **RM-ODP** | Multi-viewpoint modeling for distributed systems |
| **SABSA** | Business-driven, risk-aligned security architecture methodology |
| **TOGAF** | Enterprise architecture methodology for business and IT alignment |
| **Zachman Framework** | Taxonomy for organizing architectural artifacts across viewpoints |
| **DODAF** | Defense-focused architecture modeling for mission-critical systems |
| **FEAF** | Standardized architecture framework for U.S. federal civilian agencies |

Each document provides:
- Purpose and application focus
- Core concepts and structures
- Relevance to security architecture
- Integration notes with other frameworks
- Summary insights for real-world practice

## How to Use These Materials

- **For foundational knowledge:** Understand where each framework fits in architecture and security design.
- **For selection and adaptation:** Choose frameworks or combinations based on your organization's mission, size, and regulatory obligations.
- **For communication:** Improve architecture documentation clarity, traceability, and stakeholder engagement.
- **For practical execution:** Integrate methodologies into architecture review boards, project designs, governance models, and assurance cases.

Mastering these methodologies strengthens your ability to move between strategy and implementation, between business goals and security design, and between abstract models and concrete systems.

*Architecture methodologies provide structure, but not limitation. As a Security Architect, your skill is not in rigidly following a framework. It is in understanding when to apply structure, when to adapt, and when to innovate to protect what matters most.*
