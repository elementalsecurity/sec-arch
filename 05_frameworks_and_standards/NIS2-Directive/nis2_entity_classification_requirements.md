# NIS2 Directive: Entity Classification and Requirements Breakdown

The **NIS2 Directive** (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) establishes cybersecurity requirements for a broad range of public and private entities across the EU. Entities falling under the Directive are categorized as either **Essential Entities (EEs)** or **Important Entities (IEs)** based on their criticality and sector.

---

## Understanding NIS2 Applicability: Do You Qualify?

To determine whether your organization is covered by NIS2, ask the following:

### 1. **Sector Inclusion**
NIS2 applies to entities operating in specific sectors:

- **Essential Sectors** (Annex I): Energy, Transport, Banking, Financial Market Infrastructure, Healthcare, Drinking and Waste Water, Digital Infrastructure, ICT Service Management (B2B), Public Administration, Space
- **Important Sectors** (Annex II): Postal and Courier Services, Waste Management, Manufacturing of Critical Products, Food Production, Chemicals, Digital Providers (marketplaces, platforms, search engines), Research

### 2. **Size Thresholds**

- **Medium and Large Entities** are automatically in scope:
  - **Medium**: ≥50 employees and/or €10M+ annual turnover
  - **Large**: ≥250 employees and/or €50M+ turnover

- **Small or Micro Enterprises** may still be in scope if:
  - Identified as critical to society, economy, or security
  - Designated by national authorities based on risk

### 3. **Exclusions**
- Defense, national security, law enforcement, and judiciary activities are explicitly excluded

## Classification: Essential vs. Important Entities

| Criteria | Essential Entities (EE) | Important Entities (IE) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sectors | Annex I | Annex II |
| Supervision | Proactive (regular audits, inspections) | Reactive (only after incidents or red flags) |
| Notification Obligations | Yes | Yes |
| Penalties | Up to €10M or 2% of annual turnover | Up to €7M or 1.4% of annual turnover |
| Examples | Energy utilities, hospitals, cloud service providers | Research labs, postal companies, food producers |

## Core Cybersecurity Requirements (Common to Both EEs and IEs)

### Article 21: Cybersecurity Risk Management Measures
Entities must implement appropriate and proportionate measures including:
- Risk analysis and information system security policies
- Incident handling
- Business continuity, disaster recovery, and crisis management
- Supply chain security, including third-party risk
- Security in procurement, development, and maintenance of systems
- Policies for encryption and access control
- Use of multi-factor authentication and secure communications

### Article 23: Incident Notification Requirements
- **Initial Notification**: Within 24 hours of becoming aware of an incident
- **Intermediate Report**: Within 72 hours
- **Final Report**: Within 1 month

---

## Additional Requirements for Essential Entities

- **Article 32**: Subject to *proactive supervision* by competent authorities
  - Includes compliance audits, security scans, on-site inspections
- Mandatory registration with national authorities
- Additional reporting duties in some member states

## Additional Requirements for Important Entities

- **Article 33**: Subject to *ex-post supervision* (investigations only upon evidence of non-compliance)
- Must maintain readiness to provide evidence of compliance when required

---

## Role of National Authorities

Each EU Member State will:
- Maintain a registry of Essential and Important Entities
- Define thresholds or risk-based criteria for classifying small/micro entities as in-scope
- Coordinate supervision, audits, and incident responses

---

## How to Classify Your Entity

1. **Identify your sector**: Check Annex I (Essential) and Annex II (Important)
2. **Check your size**: ≥50 employees or €10M+ turnover likely means you're in scope
3. **Assess your risk**: Even small entities may be included based on national designations
4. **Confirm with national authority**: Verify designation via official channels (e.g., NCSC, BSI, ANSSI)

---

## Strategic Considerations for Compliance

- Conduct a gap analysis against Article 21 requirements
- Update incident response and reporting protocols
- Implement supply chain due diligence
- Register with national authorities (if required)
- Track developments and local interpretations in each Member State where you operate

## Summary

NIS2 introduces a harmonized and enforceable cybersecurity baseline across the EU. Classification as an Essential or Important Entity determines the level of oversight and supervision. Organizations should proactively assess their classification, readiness, and reporting capabilities and also take steps now to align with the Directive before enforcement begins in **October 2024**.
