# NIS2 Directive and EU Country-Specific Enhancements

The **NIS2 Directive** (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) is the European Union’s updated legislative framework for cybersecurity. It significantly expands the scope, coverage, and obligations compared to the original NIS Directive (2016), aiming to improve cyber resilience across critical and important sectors within the EU.

## Purpose of NIS2

- Strengthen the cybersecurity posture of essential and important entities across member states
- Harmonize security and reporting requirements across the EU
- Improve cross-border cooperation and incident response

## Key Highlights of NIS2

- **Expanded Scope**: Applies to a wider set of entities, now classified as:
  - **Essential Entities** (e.g., energy, transport, healthcare, banking, digital infrastructure)
  - **Important Entities** (e.g., postal services, waste management, food production, digital providers)

- **Obligations for Covered Entities**:
  - Implement appropriate technical, operational, and organizational measures
  - Perform risk analysis and incident prevention
  - Adopt supply chain security measures
  - Report significant incidents within 24 hours (initial report), 72 hours (status update), and one month (final report)

- **Governance and Accountability**:
  - Executive management must oversee and be accountable for cybersecurity compliance
  - Entities must designate a responsible point of contact for cybersecurity

- **Enforcement and Penalties**:
  - Fines for non-compliance: up to €10 million or 2% of global annual turnover for Essential Entities
  - National authorities may suspend operations or hold management personally accountable

## Security Measures Required

1. Risk analysis and information system security policies
2. Incident handling procedures
3. Business continuity and crisis management
4. Supply chain security and supplier risk assessment
5. Secure development practices and vulnerability management
6. Cryptography and access control policies

## Reporting and Supervision

- Entities must report significant incidents to the national CSIRT or competent authority
- Authorities will maintain a registry of covered entities
- Annual oversight assessments and potential onsite inspections

## Country-Specific Enhancements (Selected Examples)

### Germany
- **IT-Sicherheitsgesetz 2.0** strengthens obligations for KRITIS (Critical Infrastructure) entities beyond NIS2 minimums
- Requires deployment of attack detection systems and registration with the BSI (Federal Office for Information Security)

### France
- **ANSSI** provides prescriptive security guidelines tailored to French operators of essential services
- Additional requirements for auditing, encryption use, and physical protection of systems

### Netherlands
- **NCSC-NL** guides enforcement of NIS2 in partnership with local authorities
- The Wet Beveiliging Netwerk- en Informatiesystemen (Wbni) will be updated to align with NIS2 obligations

### Belgium
- The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB) has published specific thresholds and templates for incident reporting and impact classification

### Italy
- Enforcement led by ACN (Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale)
- Mandatory registration and vulnerability disclosure practices are outlined for covered entities

### Poland
- NASK (National Research Institute) operates the national CSIRT and leads supervision
- Local alignment with EU-level incident thresholds, with mandatory platform registration

## Strategic Role for Security Architects

Security Architects play a key role in:
- Designing compliance-ready infrastructure and processes
- Leading risk assessments and security gap analyses
- Aligning Zero Trust and ISO/NIST controls with NIS2 requirements
- Automating incident detection, reporting, and response workflows
- Advising executive leadership on governance and strategic alignment

## Summary

NIS2 sets a new standard for cybersecurity governance in Europe. Security Architects must ensure that technical architectures, operational practices, and governance processes align with both the directive’s requirements and the national implementations that apply to each business footprint within the EU.
