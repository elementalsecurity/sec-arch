# SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) Compliance for Security Architects

The **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)** is a U.S. federal law enacted in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting by public companies. While primarily focused on financial controls, SOX has significant cybersecurity implications, especially in IT systems that impact the accuracy and confidentiality of financial reporting.

---

## Purpose of SOX

- Improve corporate transparency and accountability
- Prevent accounting fraud and insider abuse
- Enforce internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)
- Hold executives personally accountable for financial statements

---

## SOX Applicability

Applies to:
- All U.S. **public companies** listed on stock exchanges
- **Foreign companies** listed on U.S. exchanges
- Private companies planning IPOs (preparation phase)
- IT service providers and SaaS vendors supporting financial systems

---

## Key SOX Sections with Security Relevance

### Section 302 – Corporate Responsibility
- Executives must certify the accuracy of financial reports
- Requires disclosure of material weaknesses and fraud

### Section 404 – Internal Control Effectiveness
- Requires annual management assessment of internal controls
- Independent auditors must evaluate and report on control effectiveness
- Impacts systems that process, store, or transmit financial data

---

## Cybersecurity and IT Controls Under SOX

SOX compliance requires **general IT controls (GITCs)** and **application-level controls**:

### General IT Controls (GITCs)
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Change management and version control
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Logical security and user provisioning
- Segregation of duties (SoD)

### Application Controls
- Input validation and data integrity checks
- Audit logging of financial transactions
- Authorization workflows and exception handling

---

## Role of Security Architects

Security Architects must:
- Design systems with control points to support SOX compliance
- Implement audit logging, access reviews, and configuration management
- Ensure strong controls for authentication and authorization in financial systems
- Work closely with internal audit, risk, and compliance teams
- Align cloud or SaaS architectures to meet control attestation requirements (e.g., SOC 1 Type II)

---

## SOX Audit Process

1. **Scoping**: Identify systems and processes that impact financial reporting
2. **Control Mapping**: Link controls to business processes and financial assertions
3. **Testing**: Evaluate control design and operating effectiveness
4. **Remediation**: Address control gaps and document risk acceptances
5. **Reporting**: Provide evidence to internal and external auditors

---

## Frameworks That Support SOX Compliance

- **COSO Framework** (used for ICFR assessment)
- **COBIT 2019** (IT governance and control)
- **NIST CSF** (risk-based alignment)
- **ISO/IEC 27001** (for infosec policy and controls)

---

## Strategic Considerations

- Align IT architecture with financial process owners early
- Segment systems and data stores tied to financial reporting
- Automate audit evidence collection where feasible
- Prepare for control attestation in M&A, IPO, or investor due diligence

---

## Summary

SOX compliance isn't just a financial obligation, it's a security imperative (really?). Security Architects play a crucial role in ensuring system controls that maintain the **integrity, availability, and confidentiality** of financial systems and reporting pipelines. Embedding these controls into system design helps avoid audit findings, enables executive signoff, and ensures investor trust.
