# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 is a widely adopted, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity outcomes across all sectors. Version 2.0 expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure to all organizations and emphasizes governance, supply chain risk, and measurable outcomes.

## Purpose of the Framework

NIST CSF 2.0 helps organizations:
- Understand and communicate cybersecurity risk
- Align business and cybersecurity strategies
- Build and mature cybersecurity programs
- Support compliance with other standards and regulations

## Structure of the Framework

The CSF 2.0 is organized into three main components:

### 1. **Core Functions** (6 Functions)
Each function represents a high-level cybersecurity goal:

- **Govern**: Establish and monitor the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.
- **Identify**: Understand the organizational context to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
- **Protect**: Develop and implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
- **Detect**: Develop and implement activities to identify cybersecurity events.
- **Respond**: Take action regarding detected incidents to minimize impact.
- **Recover**: Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities impaired due to cybersecurity incidents.

### 2. **Categories and Subcategories**
Each function is broken down into **categories** (outcomes), and then further into **subcategories** (specific technical and managerial activities). These allow organizations to tailor and prioritize activities.

### 3. **Implementation Examples and Informative References**
Guidance includes mappings to other standards such as:
- NIST SP 800-53
- ISO/IEC 27001
- CIS Controls
- COBIT

## Key Enhancements in Version 2.0

- Addition of the **Govern** function as a first-class pillar
- Expanded focus on **supply chain risk management** and third-party oversight
- Emphasis on **outcome-based** metrics and program evaluation
- Improved support for **framework profiles** and use cases

## Implementation Tiers (Contextual Use)
Tiers help organizations assess the maturity and rigor of their cybersecurity practices:

- Tier 1: Partial
- Tier 2: Risk Informed
- Tier 3: Repeatable
- Tier 4: Adaptive

These are not maturity levels, but help contextualize how deeply risk management is embedded into operations.

## Profiles
Framework Profiles allow organizations to:
- Align business needs with cybersecurity outcomes
- Customize the CSF Core to reflect unique priorities
- Define a "Current" and "Target" Profile to guide gap assessments

## Importance for Security Architects

NIST CSF 2.0 provides Security Architects with a comprehensive, structured approach to:
- Align security initiatives with business goals
- Communicate risks and priorities to leadership
- Map and justify controls using common language
- Support continuous program improvement

It is a flexible, scalable foundation for building risk-informed and resilient security architectures in any organization.
