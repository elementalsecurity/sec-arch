# EU Data Act

The **EU Data Act** (Regulation (EU) 2023/2854) is a key pillar of the European Union’s digital strategy, aimed at creating a fair and innovative data economy. It complements the GDPR by focusing on **access to and use of non-personal and industrial data**, enabling broader data sharing and interoperability while safeguarding rights and competition.

## Purpose of the EU Data Act

- Enhance access to and use of data across sectors
- Empower consumers and businesses with control over their data
- Create a fair data-sharing environment between stakeholders
- Support innovation and digital transformation in the EU

## Scope of the Regulation

The Data Act applies to:
- Manufacturers and users of connected products (e.g., IoT devices, smart cars, industrial sensors)
- Providers of related services (e.g., cloud, platforms, and analytics)
- Public bodies requesting data for exceptional public interest
- Gatekeepers under the Digital Markets Act (DMA)

## Key Provisions

### 1. **User Access to Data**
- Users must be granted direct access to data generated by connected products or related services
- Users may request that data be shared with third parties of their choice

### 2. **Fairness in B2B and B2C Contracts**
- Data holders must negotiate fairly and transparently
- Unilateral clauses by dominant parties are subject to scrutiny
- Standard contractual terms will be provided to balance market power

### 3. **Data Sharing with Public Sector Bodies**
- Public authorities can request access to data from private sector entities in cases of public emergencies or exceptional need
- Requests must be proportionate and strictly necessary

### 4. **Cloud Portability and Interoperability**
- Facilitates easier switching between cloud providers ("cloud portability")
- Imposes limits on egress fees and technical barriers to switching
- Requires interoperability and standardization of cloud services and data formats

### 5. **Protection of Trade Secrets and IP**
- Sharing obligations must not compromise trade secrets or data protection rules
- Data access is subject to appropriate safeguards to protect legitimate interests

## Compliance Requirements for Organizations

- Review and amend product and service designs to ensure data is accessible to users
- Prepare for third-party data-sharing requests with appropriate controls and processes
- Update contractual frameworks to comply with fairness rules
- Adapt cloud and platform strategies for compliance with portability provisions
- Ensure governance mechanisms protect trade secrets and personal data during sharing

## Interplay with GDPR

- The Data Act primarily targets non-personal or industrial data, but overlaps with GDPR when personal data is involved
- Controllers must align lawful basis, transparency, and data minimization across both regulations
- Data sharing must respect GDPR rights (e.g., consent, access, erasure)

## Role of Security Architects and Privacy Engineers

Security and Privacy teams must:
- Design technical enforcement of access rights and sharing controls
- Embed audit logging and authorization for data extraction/export
- Implement encryption, pseudonymization, and secure transfer mechanisms
- Ensure cloud/data architecture aligns with interoperability mandates
- Support legal teams with Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where GDPR applies

## Strategic Impact

The EU Data Act redefines how value is extracted from data by promoting **data democratization**, **fair competition**, and **trust in digital ecosystems**. Organizations must architect for open, secure, and interoperable environments that respect user rights and regulatory boundaries.
