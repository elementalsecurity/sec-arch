# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is the EU’s comprehensive privacy and data protection law. Enforceable since May 25, 2018, GDPR governs how organizations collect, process, store, and transfer personal data of individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA).

## Purpose of the GDPR

- Strengthen and unify data protection for individuals within the EU
- Give individuals more control over their personal data
- Harmonize data privacy laws across EU member states
- Establish accountability and governance requirements for data processing

## Scope and Applicability

- **Material Scope**: Applies to any processing of personal data, whether automated or manual (structured filing systems)
- **Territorial Scope**: Applies to controllers or processors inside the EU, and non-EU organizations that offer goods/services to or monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU

## Key Definitions

- **Personal Data**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
- **Controller**: Entity that determines the purpose and means of processing
- **Processor**: Entity that processes data on behalf of a controller
- **Data Subject**: The individual whose data is being processed

## Core Principles (Article 5)

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**
2. **Purpose Limitation**
3. **Data Minimization**
4. **Accuracy**
5. **Storage Limitation**
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**
7. **Accountability**

## Legal Bases for Processing (Article 6)

- Consent
- Performance of a contract
- Legal obligation
- Vital interests
- Public task
- Legitimate interests (balancing test required)

## Data Subject Rights

- Right to be informed
- Right of access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure ("Right to be forgotten")
- Right to restrict processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object
- Rights related to automated decision-making and profiling

## Organizational and Technical Measures

- Implement data protection policies and training
- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
- Maintain Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)
- Secure data through encryption, pseudonymization, and access control
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required
- Notify breaches to authorities and affected individuals (within 72 hours)

## Cross-Border Data Transfers

- Use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), or adequacy decisions
- Apply supplementary measures per Schrems II decision (e.g., technical safeguards)

## Enforcement and Penalties

- Supervisory authorities (Data Protection Authorities or DPAs) oversee enforcement
- Tiered fines:
  - Up to €10M or 2% of global annual turnover (for administrative breaches)
  - Up to €20M or 4% of global annual turnover (for fundamental rights violations)

## Role of Security Architects and Privacy Engineers

- Ensure Privacy by Design and by Default in system and software architecture
- Implement user consent and preference mechanisms
- Enable secure data lifecycle controls: access, encryption, retention, deletion
- Map data flows and support DPIAs and RoPA documentation
- Align infrastructure and vendors with cross-border transfer rules

## Strategic Importance

GDPR has become the global benchmark for privacy regulation. Its emphasis on transparency, accountability, and user control requires technical leaders to integrate privacy deeply into design and operations. GDPR-compliant architecture is not only legally necessary—but a trust enabler in the modern data economy.
