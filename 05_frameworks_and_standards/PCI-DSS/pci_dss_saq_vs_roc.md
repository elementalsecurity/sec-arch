# Understanding the Differences Between PCI DSS SAQs and ROCs

Entities subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) must validate their compliance annually. This can be done through either a **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** or a **Report on Compliance (ROC)**, depending on the merchant’s business model, transaction volume, and service relationship to cardholder data.

---

## What is an SAQ?

A **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** is a validation tool for merchants and service providers **not required** to undergo a formal assessment by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA). It includes a series of yes/no questions based on the 12 PCI DSS requirements.

### Key Features:
- Self-completed by the entity (merchant or service provider)
- Used by **small-to-medium-sized merchants**
- Intended for specific business models
- Must be accompanied by an **Attestation of Compliance (AOC)**

### Common SAQ Types:

| SAQ Type | For Merchants That... | Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **A** | Only use third-party payment processors with no electronic storage of cardholder data | No CDE; outsourcing only |
| **A-EP** | E-commerce merchants using third-party payment processing, but their website impacts the security of the payment page | Website indirectly impacts CDE |
| **B** | Use only standalone dial-out terminals with no IP connectivity | No electronic storage; isolated terminals |
| **B-IP** | Use standalone IP-connected payment terminals not storing cardholder data | Limited CDE via IP-connected terminals |
| **C** | Use payment applications connected to the internet, but no cardholder data is stored electronically | Defined CDE; limited environment |
| **C-VT** | Manually enter transactions via virtual terminals on isolated devices | No storage; limited use scope |
| **D** | Store cardholder data electronically or do not fit other SAQ types | Full CDE in scope |
| **D-Service Provider** | Are service providers storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data | Full scope; annual submission to customers |

### Pros:
- Less resource-intensive
- Faster to complete (for simple environments)
- Can be used internally for tracking and remediation

### Cons:
- Requires significant internal validation
- Higher risk of inaccurate submissions
- Not accepted by all acquirers or partners

## What is a ROC?

A **Report on Compliance (ROC)** is a detailed assessment conducted by a **Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)** or internal auditor for **Level 1 merchants** and **large service providers**.

### Key Features:
- Required for Level 1 merchants (>6 million Visa transactions/year)
- Mandated for **service providers** that store, process, or transmit cardholder data
- Involves on-site validation and testing by a QSA
- Delivered with a formal Attestation of Compliance (AOC)

### Components of a ROC:
- Executive Summary
- Description of in-scope systems
- Detailed requirement-by-requirement assessment
- Evidence and findings
- Compensating control documentation (if applicable)

### Pros:
- High assurance for business partners and regulators
- Detailed third-party validation
- Identifies real-world risks, not just checkbox compliance

### Cons:
- Time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Requires scheduled audits and remediation cycles
- Higher cost due to QSA engagement

## When to Use SAQ vs. ROC

| Criteria | SAQ | ROC |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Small merchant with no storage of cardholder data | ✅ | ❌ |
| Merchant handling >6M transactions/year | ❌ | ✅ |
| Using only tokenized or outsourced payment flows | ✅ (A or A-EP) | ❌ |
| Service provider hosting or transmitting data | ❌ | ✅ |
| Required by acquiring bank or card brand | Depends | Depends |

---

## Hybrid and Real-World Scenarios

- A merchant may begin with an SAQ but transition to a ROC as transaction volumes grow or business models change.
- Some acquirers require SAQ D even for smaller merchants if they touch cardholder data directly.
- Hosting providers and managed service companies almost always require a ROC.

---

## Strategic Guidance for Security Architects and Compliance Leads

- Define the CDE clearly and apply **network segmentation** to reduce scope
- Minimize storage and processing of cardholder data when possible
- Encourage tokenization and secure payment gateways to qualify for lighter SAQs
- Build evidence and internal controls in a way that can scale toward ROC readiness
- Align PCI DSS validation with broader compliance frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)

---

## Summary

**SAQs** offer a streamlined path for lower-risk merchants, while **ROCs** provide the rigorous assurance required for high-volume merchants and critical service providers. Understanding your organization's profile, transaction flow, and CDE scope is key to choosing the right approach by ensuring lasting PCI DSS compliance.
