# PCI DSS 4.0.1 Framework (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

**PCI DSS 4.0.1**, published by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), is the most recent version of the global standard for securing cardholder data. It sets forth mandatory technical and operational requirements for all entities involved in storing, processing, or transmitting payment card data. Version 4.0.1 clarifies and corrects minor inconsistencies in 4.0, while maintaining the structural overhaul introduced in 4.0.

---

## PURPOSE OF PCI DSS

- Secure the payment card ecosystem (including merchants, service providers, and processors)
- Prevent data breaches, fraud, and unauthorized access to cardholder data
- Establish consistent global security controls and compliance standards
- Enable organizations to align their security programs with risk-based, customized approaches

---

## STRUCTURE OF PCI DSS 4.0.1

The framework is divided into 12 core requirements grouped under 6 logical control objectives:

### Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems
1. **Install and maintain network security controls**
2. **Apply secure configurations to all system components**

### Protect Account Data
3. **Protect stored account data**
4. **Protect cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks**

### Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
5. **Protect all systems and networks from malicious software**
6. **Develop and maintain secure systems and software**

### Implement Strong Access Control Measures
7. **Restrict access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know**
8. **Identify users and authenticate access to system components**
9. **Restrict physical access to cardholder data**

### Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
10. **Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data**
11. **Test security of systems and networks regularly**

### Maintain an Information Security Policy
12. **Support information security with organizational policies and programs**

## SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN VERSION 4.0 / 4.0.1

- **Customizable Approach**: Allows flexibility in meeting control objectives through customized implementations, as long as security outcomes are met
- **Expanded Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all access into the cardholder data environment (CDE), not just remote access
- **Targeted Risk Analyses**: Entities must perform specific risk analyses to determine control frequencies and define entity-specific parameters
- **Expanded Requirements for Encryption, Logging, and Access Control**
- **Enhanced Testing Procedures**: Requirements contain updated validation methods for both control and documentation evidence

---

## CARDHOLDER DATA ENVIRONMENT (CDE) FOCUS

The CDE includes:
- Systems storing, processing, or transmitting PAN
- Connected systems that could impact security (e.g., jump servers, web interfaces)

**Segmentation** is critical and must be validated to ensure non-CDE systems are truly isolated.

---

## SUPPLEMENTAL DOCUMENTS AND GUIDANCE

PCI DSS 4.0.1 is supported by:
- **Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs)**
- **Attestation of Compliance (AOC)** templates
- **Prioritized Approach Tool**
- **Guidance on customized implementations**
- **Appendices for service providers, multi-tenant environments, and shared hosting providers**

---

## VALIDATION METHODS

- **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** – For smaller merchants, based on eligibility
- **Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Audit** – For larger or higher-risk organizations
- **Internal Security Assessor (ISA)** – For organizations with PCI SSC-trained staff

---

## DEADLINES AND COMPLIANCE TIMELINE

- **March 2024**: PCI DSS v3.2.1 officially retired
- **March 2025**: Deadline to fully implement new v4.0 requirements (those listed as “future-dated”)

---

## ROLE OF SECURITY ARCHITECTS

Security Architects must:
- Design secure architectures that fully scope and isolate the CDE
- Apply layered security (Defense-in-Depth) aligned to PCI DSS domains
- Select and implement compliant cryptographic controls, key management, and tokenization
- Embed secure coding practices for PCI-scoped applications
- Design and validate network segmentation strategies
- Architect logging, SIEM, and file integrity monitoring (FIM) to meet DSS 4.0.1 expectations
- Work with QSA or internal compliance to align technical design with DSS interpretations

---

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS

PCI DSS 4.0.1 aligns well with:
- **NIST SP 800-53 / 800-171**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**
- **NIST CSF 2.0**
- **CIS Controls v8**

Mapping these helps consolidate controls and reduce duplicative effort during audits.

---

## SUMMARY

PCI DSS 4.0.1 reflects the evolution of payment security into a risk-based, adaptive compliance framework. It challenges Security Architects to combine structured controls with flexible architectures that are both auditable and resilient. Implementing PCI DSS effectively enables organizations to build trust, reduce risk, and protect cardholder data in an increasingly complex threat landscape.
