# OWASP: Open Worldwide Application Security Project

OWASP is a nonprofit foundation focused on improving the security of software through community-led open-source projects, tools, and educational resources. OWASP's standards are widely adopted for application security and serve as a foundational resource for secure software design and testing.

## Purpose of OWASP

- Raise awareness of common application vulnerabilities
- Provide practical tools and guidance to secure software
- Support developers, architects, testers, and security professionals
- Align software security practices across industries

## Key OWASP Resources for Security Architects

### 1. **OWASP Top 10**
The most well-known OWASP resource, updated periodically to reflect the most critical web application security risks. The current categories include:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, Command)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### 2. **OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)**
- A detailed framework for testing the technical security controls in web applications
- Structured across three levels (L1-L3) for different assurance levels

### 3. **OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)**
- Helps organizations evaluate and improve their secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)
- Focuses on governance, design, implementation, verification, and operations

### 4. **OWASP Cheat Sheets**
- Concise, best-practice security guidance for specific development topics (e.g., session management, CSRF prevention, HTTPS enforcement)

### 5. **OWASP Mobile Top 10**
- Specialized risks for mobile app security
- Includes issues such as insecure data storage, weak authentication, and insecure communication

## How OWASP Supports Secure Architecture

- **Standardizes** secure coding and design practices
- **Guides** threat modeling and security testing efforts
- **Supports** secure DevOps and continuous assurance
- **Aligns** application security controls with compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, NIST, ISO 27001)

## Role of Security Architects

Security Architects use OWASP to:
- Embed security into system and software design from the start
- Guide development teams with Top 10 risks and ASVS
- Establish architectural and coding standards
- Conduct reviews and assessments with OWASP as a benchmark
- Align secure development practices with governance models

OWASP is an essential toolset for every Security Architect who influences how secure code is built, deployed, and maintained across modern digital ecosystems.
