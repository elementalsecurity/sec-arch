# MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Integration Guide for Security Architects

The **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally recognized knowledge base of adversary behaviors. Developed by the MITRE Corporation, it is used by defenders to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in a structured, threat-informed manner.

---

## Purpose of MITRE ATT&CK

- Classify and understand attacker tactics and techniques
- Improve threat detection and investigation capabilities
- Enhance security architecture and defensive coverage
- Enable purple teaming, red team simulations, and threat hunting

---

## Structure of the Framework

### 1. **Tactics** (14 total)
High-level adversary goals (e.g., Initial Access, Persistence, Exfiltration)

### 2. **Techniques & Sub-techniques**
Specific methods to achieve each tactic (e.g., Credential Dumping, Process Injection)

### 3. **Mitigations**
Recommended controls or security principles to reduce the effectiveness of specific techniques

### 4. **Detections**
Guidance on logging, telemetry, and behavior patterns that help defenders identify the use of a technique

---

## Integration Use Cases for Security Architects

### 1. **Detection Engineering**
- Align SIEM rules and EDR alerts to MITRE techniques (e.g., T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter)
- Use ATT&CK tags in detection rule metadata

### 2. **Threat Hunting and Intelligence**
- Create hypothesis-driven hunts using MITRE-aligned threat actor profiles
- Prioritize detection gaps based on relevant APT groups

### 3. **SOC and Incident Response**
- Triage alerts and incidents using MITRE mappings
- Align playbooks to tactics and techniques for faster correlation

### 4. **Purple Team Exercises**
- Simulate known attacker techniques to validate detection and response
- Use tools like Atomic Red Team, Caldera, or Infection Monkey

### 5. **Security Architecture Coverage Mapping**
- Map MITRE techniques to your control landscape
- Identify where coverage exists (EDR, NDR, Firewall, DLP) and where gaps remain

## Tools for MITRE ATT&CK Integration

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** | Visualize and track coverage across techniques |
| **Sigma Rules** | Shareable SIEM detection templates mapped to ATT&CK |
| **Elastic Security**, **Splunk ESCU** | Prebuilt detections and dashboards using ATT&CK tags |
| **Microsoft 365 Defender**, **Sentinel**, **CrowdStrike**, **Palo Alto Cortex XDR** | Native ATT&CK integration |

---

## Mapping Frameworks to ATT&CK

| Framework | Example Integration |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **NIST 800-53** | Map controls to mitigations per technique (e.g., AC-6 to T1078: Valid Accounts) |
| **MITRE D3FEND** | Use defensive countermeasures aligned to ATT&CK techniques |
| **MITRE Engage** | Strategic deception and adversary engagement planning |
| **MITRE Shield** | Active defense and deception mapped to ATT&CK stages |

---

## Role of the Security Architect

Security Architects use MITRE ATT&CK to:
- Assess architecture against real-world threats
- Prioritize logging and telemetry requirements
- Design control layers informed by likely adversary behavior
- Guide investments in detection tools and automation
- Align red/blue/purple team activities with business risk and threat models

---

## Summary

MITRE ATT&CK is not just a reference, it’s an operational and strategic asset. When embedded into architecture design, detection engineering, and response programs, it allows Security Architects to make informed, threat-aware decisions and continuously improve the organization’s defensive posture.
