# HIPAA Security and Privacy Framework

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** is a U.S. federal law that establishes national standards for protecting sensitive patient information, particularly **protected health information (PHI)**. It includes both **Privacy** and **Security Rules**, and applies to all covered entities and their business associates.

---

## PURPOSE OF HIPAA

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI
- Protect individuals’ medical records and personal health information
- Set national standards for electronic healthcare transactions and health information security
- Provide patients with rights over their health data

---

## SCOPE OF HIPAA

HIPAA applies to:
- **Covered Entities**: Healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses
- **Business Associates**: Vendors and subcontractors that handle PHI on behalf of covered entities

---

## HIPAA PRIVACY RULE

- Regulates use and disclosure of PHI
- Requires privacy notices and patient consent for data sharing
- Grants individuals rights to:
  - Access and obtain a copy of their health records
  - Request corrections
  - Restrict certain disclosures
  - Receive an accounting of disclosures
- Applies to all forms of PHI (paper, oral, electronic)

---

## HIPAA SECURITY RULE

- Applies specifically to **electronic PHI (ePHI)**
- Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards:

### 1. Administrative Safeguards
- Risk analysis and management
- Workforce training and management
- Security policies and procedures
- Contingency planning (e.g., backups, disaster recovery)

### 2. Physical Safeguards
- Facility access controls
- Workstation use and security
- Device and media controls (e.g., disposal, re-use)

### 3. Technical Safeguards
- Access controls (unique user IDs, emergency access)
- Audit controls (logging access and activity)
- Integrity controls (protect against improper alteration or destruction)
- Transmission security (encryption of data in transit)

---

## BREACH NOTIFICATION RULE

- Requires notification to individuals, HHS, and sometimes the media for breaches involving unsecured PHI
- Notification must occur **within 60 days** of discovering the breach

---

## ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

- Enforced by the **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR)**
- Penalties are tiered by level of negligence:
  - Tier 1: $100–$50,000 per violation
  - Tier 4: Up to $1.5 million annually per violation type
- Willful neglect or failure to act can lead to civil or criminal prosecution

---

## ROLE OF SECURITY ARCHITECTS AND PRIVACY TEAMS

Security Architects must:
- Design HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for handling ePHI
- Integrate identity management, audit logging, and encryption into system architecture
- Ensure secure API integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems
- Establish secure data storage, transmission, and access models
- Support risk assessments and remediation tracking
- Enable HIPAA-required features like emergency access and automatic logoff

Privacy teams must:
- Conduct regular HIPAA training and awareness programs
- Maintain and update privacy policies and procedures
- Coordinate with IT and legal teams for breach response and reporting

---

## INTEROPERABILITY AND INDUSTRY ALIGNMENT

HIPAA intersects with:
- **HITECH Act** (promotes adoption of secure electronic health records)
- **NIST SP 800-66** (provides implementation guidance for HIPAA Security Rule)
- **ISO/IEC 27799** (healthcare information security management)

---

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

HIPAA is more than a compliance checkbox, it is a trust framework between healthcare entities and patients. It reinforces data governance, accountability, and patient rights. Security Architects must ensure that technical designs uphold these principles while enabling secure innovation in digital health.
