# CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls)

The CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) are a prioritized set of best practices developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture. These controls offer prescriptive, actionable steps for defending against the most common and impactful threats.

## Purpose of the CIS Controls

- Provide practical, prioritized actions for cyber defense
- Reduce attack surfaces and improve visibility
- Help organizations implement a measurable, risk-informed security program
- Align with other frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001, PCI DSS)

## Structure of the CIS Controls v8

The controls are grouped into three Implementation Groups (IGs) based on organizational size, resources, and risk profile:

- **IG1**: Basic cyber hygiene (minimum standard)
- **IG2**: For organizations handling sensitive data or with moderate risk exposure
- **IG3**: For organizations with advanced cybersecurity needs or high-risk profiles

There are 18 top-level Controls in version 8:

### Foundational Controls (IG1)
1. **Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets**
2. **Inventory and Control of Software Assets**
3. **Data Protection**
4. **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software**
5. **Account Management**
6. **Access Control Management**
7. **Continuous Vulnerability Management**
8. **Audit Log Management**
9. **Email and Web Browser Protections**
10. **Malware Defenses**

### Advanced Controls (IG2/IG3)
11. **Data Recovery**
12. **Network Infrastructure Management**
13. **Security Awareness and Skills Training**
14. **Security Operations Center (SOC) Capabilities**
15. **Incident Response Management**
16. **Application Software Security**
17. **Penetration Testing**
18. **Security Governance**

## Key Benefits

- Highly prescriptive and easy to implement
- Maps well to other frameworks
- Suitable for organizations at all maturity levels
- Updated regularly based on real-world threat intelligence

## CIS Controls vs. NIST CSF

| Feature                  | CIS Controls         | NIST CSF               |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Prescriptive Guidance   | High                 | Low (outcome-based)     |
| Prioritized by Risk     | Yes (IG1–IG3)        | Not directly            |
| Control Count           | 18 (v8)              | ~100+ Subcategories     |
| Use Case                | Implementation       | Risk Management & Planning |

## Role of Security Architects

Security Architects use CIS Controls to:
- Implement effective foundational security in new environments
- Design systems aligned to control families (e.g., access, audit, logging)
- Prioritize defenses based on threat landscape
- Measure and report on control implementation maturity

CIS Controls are often used in tandem with NIST CSF or ISO 27001 to translate high-level risk objectives into actionable, technically enforceable controls.
