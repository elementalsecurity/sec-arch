# ISO/IEC 27001 Framework

ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard that specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive information and ensuring risk management, compliance, and business continuity.

## Purpose of ISO 27001

- Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information
- Establish a culture of continual security improvement
- Provide assurance to stakeholders, customers, and regulators
- Enable certification of compliance to recognized international standards

## Core Structure of the Standard

### 1. **ISMS Context and Requirements**
- Organizational context
- Needs and expectations of stakeholders
- Scope of the ISMS
- Leadership and governance roles

### 2. **Risk-Based Approach**
- Risk identification and assessment methodology
- Risk treatment plan based on organizational risk appetite
- Statement of Applicability (SoA)

### 3. **Security Controls (Annex A)**
- 93 controls grouped into 4 themes:
  - Organizational controls
  - People controls
  - Physical controls
  - Technological controls

### 4. **Mandatory Clauses**
Clauses 4 through 10 define the management system requirements:
- Clause 4: Context of the organization
- Clause 5: Leadership
- Clause 6: Planning
- Clause 7: Support (resources, awareness, communication)
- Clause 8: Operation (risk management)
- Clause 9: Performance evaluation (monitoring, audits)
- Clause 10: Improvement (nonconformity, continual improvement)

## Key Artifacts

- **Information Security Policy**
- **Risk Register and Treatment Plan**
- **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**
- **Asset Inventory and Data Classification Scheme**
- **Audit Plan and Records**

## Certification Process

1. Gap Assessment (optional)
2. Stage 1 Audit (documentation review)
3. Stage 2 Audit (implementation verification)
4. Certification Issued (valid for 3 years with annual surveillance audits)

## ISO 27001 vs. NIST CSF

| Feature                 | ISO 27001             | NIST CSF             |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Global Recognition     | Yes                    | Primarily U.S.       |
| Certifiable            | Yes                    | No                   |
| Prescriptive           | Yes (Annex A controls) | No (outcome-focused) |
| Risk-Based             | Yes                    | Yes                  |

## Importance for Security Architects

ISO 27001 offers a formal, auditable structure that aligns security controls with risk management and governance. Security Architects can use ISO 27001 to:
- Design systems that meet certifiable standards
- Ensure integration with enterprise risk management
- Structure programs around a proven lifecycle of planning, operation, evaluation, and improvement
- Map technical architecture decisions to organizational compliance goals

As a globally recognized standard, ISO 27001 enhances credibility and aligns well with other frameworks such as NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and COBIT.
