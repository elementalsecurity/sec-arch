# NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1 & 2: Systems Security Engineering

**NIST Special Publication 800-160**, titled *Systems Security Engineering*, is the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s guidance for building secure, resilient systems throughout the entire system development life cycle (SDLC). It is based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and integrates engineering discipline with cybersecurity principles.

This two-volume standard provides both strategic guidance (Vol. 1) and engineering tactics for cyber-resiliency (Vol. 2).

## Purpose of NIST SP 800-160

- Institutionalize **security as an engineering discipline**
- Integrate cybersecurity objectives into **system architecture and design**
- Establish **life-cycle-based security engineering** practices
- Enable development of systems that are **secure by design and resilient by default**

---

## Volume 1: Foundational Systems Security Engineering

### Core Objectives:
- Align with **ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288** systems engineering life cycle
- Ensure security is embedded from concept to decommission
- Establish security requirements as **system-level quality attributes**

### Major Process Areas:
- Stakeholder Requirements Definition
- Requirements Analysis
- Architectural Design
- Implementation
- Integration and Verification
- Validation and Transition
- Operation, Maintenance, and Disposal

### Security Engineering Tasks:
- Threat and hazard analysis
- Vulnerability identification
- Risk-based security requirement allocation
- Secure system architecture development
- Security metrics and test criteria definition

---

## Volume 2: Cyber Resiliency Engineering

Volume 2 introduces **cyber-resiliency constructs and implementation tactics** to strengthen systems under active threat conditions.

### Cyber Resiliency Goals:
1. **Anticipate** – Predict and prepare for potential attacks
2. **Withstand** – Maintain capability under attack
3. **Recover** – Restore functionality and mission capabilities
4. **Adapt** – Evolve based on feedback and learning

### Implementation Tactics (Aligned with MITRE's Resiliency Framework):
- Dynamic reconfiguration
- Redundancy and diversity
- Moving target defense
- Deception and obscurity
- Segmentation and containment

## Integration with Other Frameworks

| Framework | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **RMF (SP 800-37)** | SSE tasks support security categorization, control selection, and authorization |
| **NIST CSF** | SSE reinforces Identify, Protect, and Recover functions |
| **MITRE ATT&CK/D3FEND** | Engineering tactics mapped to adversary TTPs and defensive countermeasures |
| **ISO/IEC 27001 / 15288** | Structured process integration for InfoSec and Systems Engineering teams |

## Benefits for Security Architects

Security Architects can use SP 800-160 to:
- Translate **mission needs into engineering requirements**
- Align security activities with **design, development, and operations**
- Integrate **resilience, survivability, and assurance** into system models
- Support **assurance cases** with engineering traceability
- Design systems that satisfy **FISMA**, **FedRAMP**, and **critical infrastructure mandates**

---

## Tooling and Resources

- Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools: Cameo, Sparx EA, Capella
- Threat modeling: LINDDUN, STRIDE, MITRE
- Architecture languages: SysML, ArchiMate, UML with security profiles

---

## Summary

**NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 1 & 2** offers a comprehensive blueprint for integrating cybersecurity into systems engineering. By embedding security from the outset, organizations can build **mission-assured, survivable, and adaptive systems** capable of operating securely under real-world threats. It is an essential framework for Security Architects working in defense, critical infrastructure, aerospace, and high-assurance domains.
