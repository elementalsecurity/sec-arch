# Tradeoff Decision Template

This template is used to formally document tradeoff decisions made during Security Architecture Reviews, system design discussions, or major project milestones.

Capturing tradeoffs helps ensure that risk-based decisions are transparent, traceable, and defensible during future audits, incidents, or architecture evaluations.
